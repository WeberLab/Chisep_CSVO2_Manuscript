During QSM, however, paramagnetic sources can be obscured by opposing diamagnetic sources such as water and myelin. We sought to evaluate whether QSM images alone, or an algorithm that attempts to isolate their paramagnetic components, are more accurate in measuring oxygenation of the major cerebral veins in a cohort of neonates born preterm. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether a difference in oxygenation existed between the major cerebral veins.\n  \n  **Methods**: 19 neonates born preterm were scanned on a 3T research MRI at term equivalent age. The protocol included a multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence. The acquired imaging data were processed as QSM images to obtain the susceptibility values of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV). These values were used to calculate the oxygen saturation (SvO2) of the SSS and CCV.  QSM images were subsequently processed to isolate their paramagnetic components. SvO2 values of the SSS and CCV were calculated again from the paramagnetic components.\n  \n  **Results**: The mean SvO2 values of the SSS and CCV calculated from QSM images were found to be 72.4% (SD, 3.4%) and 68.7% (SD, 3.5%), respectively. The mean SvO2 values calculated from paramagnetic components were found to be 58.1% (SD, 7.3%) for the SSS and 57.7% (SD, 7.0%) for the CCV.\n  \n  **Conclusion**: SSS SvO2 values derived from paramagnetic components agreed well with the existing literature and were closer than the values derived from QSM, however, they displayed greater variability. Although the CCV SvO2 data from QSM aligns more closely with existing literature, it is important to note that the current literature on this topic remains relatively limited in the CCV. Thus, decomposing QSM images into paramagnetic components shows great promise as a method for more accurately measuring cerebral oxygenation in neonates but may require more research to improve precision. Notably, no significant difference in oxygenation was observed between the CCV and the SSS, contrasting with previous studies.\n  \nplain-language-summary: |\n  \nkey-points:\n  - \ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: [ references.bib, Gavin_Thesis_Ref.bib ]\ncitation:\n  container-title: Unpublished\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# options\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  # fig.width=8, fig.height=5, \n  # out.width=\"50%\",\n  # fig.align=\"center\",\n  echo=FALSE, \n  message=FALSE, \n  warning=FALSE\n  # cache=TRUE \n  )\nset.seed(1234) # reproducible\noptions(knitr.kable.NA = '') # how kable handles NA\noptions(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ntheme_set( theme_minimal() ) # ggplot theme\nlibrary(broom) # for nice summaries\nlibrary(knitr) # \nlibrary(kableExtra) # more tables options.
