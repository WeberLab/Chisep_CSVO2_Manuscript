During QSM, however, paramagnetic sources can be obscured by opposing diamagnetic sources such as water and myelin. We sought to evaluate whether QSM images alone, or an algorithm that attempts to isolate their paramagnetic components, are more accurate in measuring oxygenation of the major cerebral veins in a cohort of neonates born preterm. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether a difference in oxygenation existed between the major cerebral veins.\n  \n  **Methods**: 19 neonates born preterm were scanned on a 3T research MRI at term equivalent age. The protocol included a multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence. The acquired imaging data were processed as QSM images to obtain the susceptibility values of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and central cerebral veins (CCV). These values were used to calculate the oxygen saturation (SvO~2~) of the SSS and CCV.  QSM images were subsequently processed to isolate their paramagnetic components. SvO~2~ values of the SSS and CCV were calculated again from the paramagnetic components.\n  \n  **Results**: The mean SvO~2~ values of the SSS and CCV calculated from QSM images were found to be 72.4% (SD, 3.4%) and 68.7% (SD, 3.5%), respectively. The mean SvO~2~ values calculated from paramagnetic components were found to be 58.1% (SD, 7.3%) for the SSS and 57.7% (SD, 7.0%) for the CCV.\n  \n  **Conclusion**: SSS SvO~2~ values derived from paramagnetic components agreed well with the existing literature and were closer than the values derived from QSM, however, they displayed greater variability. Although the CCV SvO~2~ data from QSM aligns more closely with existing literature, it is important to note that the current literature on this topic remains relatively limited in the CCV. Thus, decomposing QSM images into paramagnetic components shows great promise as a method for more accurately measuring cerebral oxygenation in neonates but may require more research to improve precision. Notably, no significant difference in oxygenation was observed between the CCV and the SSS, contrasting with previous studies.\n  \nplain-language-summary: |\n  \nkey-points:\n  - \ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: [ Gavin_Thesis_Ref.bib ]\ncitation:\n  container-title: Unpublished\nnumber-sections: false\nnotebook-links: false\n---\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# options\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  # fig.width=8, fig.height=5, \n  # out.width=\"50%\",\n  # fig.align=\"center\",\n  echo=FALSE, \n  message=FALSE, \n  warning=FALSE\n  # cache=TRUE \n  )\nset.seed(1234) # reproducible\noptions(knitr.kable.NA = '') # how kable handles NA\noptions(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n#libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, forcats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n-- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 --\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nv ggplot2 3.5.1     v purrr   1.0.2\nv tibble  3.2.1     v dplyr   1.1.4\nv tidyr   1.3.1     v stringr 1.5.1\nv readr   2.1.5     v forcats 0.5.1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ntheme_set( theme_minimal() ) # ggplot theme\nlibrary(broom) # for nice summaries\nlibrary(knitr) # \nlibrary(kableExtra) # more tables options.

Aim for 460 words -->\n\nPreterm birth \n\nAbnormal brain development is a significant concern for parents with children born preterm, as 43% of infants that survive will have neurodevelopmental delays later in life [@dixMonitoringCerebralOxygenation2017]. Irregularities in early cerebral oxygen levels have been identified as a potential source of such delays, where too little oxygen provided during NICU care can result in white matter injury, while too much oxygen can result in reduced cortical connectivity [@rantakariEarlyOxygenLevels2021]. As such, being able to precisely, accurately, and non-invasively measure cerebral oxygenation is necessary for understanding and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates. \n\nIn the present study, we set out to determine whether a QSM image alone, or the paramagnetic component of the QSM image, is more accurate in measuring the oxygen present in the major cerebral veins of a cohort of preterm neonates. As previous QSM studies have not included the SSS, we also had a secondary aim of preserving this vessel in our QSM images and using this data to determine whether a difference in oxygenation existed between the SSS and the central cerebral veins (CCV).\n\n\n# Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\nThe study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia and Children's & Women's Hospital (H21-00655) and written informed consent was obtained from the parent/guardian for each infant.\n\n## Study population\n\nParticipant data comes from a previous study [@zhu-etal-cmro2]. Participants consisted of preterm neonates born between 25- and 31-weeks gestational age (GA) who were admitted to the level III NICU at BC Womenâ€™s Hospital. Recruitment took place over a span of one year, from February 2021 to January 2022, facilitated by a dedicated research nurse. Parents of eligible infants were approached by the research nurse prior to discharge from the NICU to explain the study objectives and seek their consent for participation. Infants meeting the criteria for inclusion were scanned for the study if they had already been discharged from the NICU, were in stable condition, and had reached a term equivalent age of 37 to 44 weeks GA. However, certain exclusion criteria were applied to ensure the homogeneity and integrity of the study sample. Infants were excluded if there was clinical evidence of a congenital malformation or syndrome, a TORCH infection, or ultrasound evidence of large parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction (\\>2 cm, Grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage).\n\n## Image acquisition\n\nMR imaging was performed on a 3.0 Tesla General Electric Discovery MR750 scanner (scanner software version DV26.0_R03) equipped with a SREE Medical Systems single-channel neonatal head coil (@tbl-mri). The scans were conducted at the BC Childrenâ€™s MRI Research Facility. Prior to the scanning procedure, subjects were carefully prepared by a research nurse. Swaddling and feeding were used to ensure the comfort and cooperation of the subjects during the scan. Importantly, no sedatives or invasive markers were utilized throughout the procedure. Subjects were placed within a specially designed SREE Medical Systems MRI compatible incubator, which facilitated both safety and motion minimization. Molded foam was strategically positioned around the head and body within the incubator to further restrict subject movement. To protect against potential hearing damage, ear plugs were employed during the scanning process. Additionally, a pulse oximeter was affixed to the subjectâ€™s foot to monitor arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate throughout the scan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-mri .cell tbl-cap='Technical parameters for MR imaging pulse sequences'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ndf <- data.frame(Scan = character(), T1w = character(), T2w = character(), pcASL = character(), SWI = character(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\ndf[1,] <- c(\"Sequence\", \"3D FSPGR\", \"3D CUBE\", \"Multi-shot 3D fast spin-echo\", \"3D spoiled GRE flow-compensated\")\ndf[2,] <- c(\"Phase-encoding direction\", \"Coronal\", \"Sagittal\", \"Axial\", \"Axial\")\ndf[3,] <- c(\"TR (ms)\", \"7.74\", \"2,300\", \"4,680\", \"30.9\")\ndf[4,] <- c(\"TE (ms)\", \"2.97\", \"66.29\", \"10.55\", \"5.24\")\ndf[5,] <- c(\"Flip angle\", \"12\\U00B0\", \"90\\U00B0\", \"111\\U00B0\", \"20\\U00B0\")\ndf[6,] <- c(\"FOV (cm)\", \"20\", \"20\", \"24\", \"25\")\ndf[7,] <- c(\"Acquisition matrix\", \"512 x 512\", \"256 x 256\", \"128 x 128\", \"256 x 256\")\ndf[8,] <- c(\"In-plane resolution (mm)\", \"0.39 x 0.39\", \"0.78 x 0.78\", \"1.875 x 1.875\", \"0.977 x 0.977\")\ndf[9,] <- c(\"Slice thickness (mm)\", \"1\", \"1\", \"4\", \"2, reconstructed to 1 with zero filling (ZIP2)\")\ndf[10,] <- c(\"Number of slices\", \"126\", \"106\", \"50\", \"92\")\ndf[11,] <- c(\"Additional parameters\", \"n/a\", \"n/a\", \"1,450 ms label period;\\n 2,025 ms pulse label;\\n 24 control-label pairs\", \"n/a\")\ndf[12,] <- c(\"Scan duration\", \"4 min 39 s\", \"5 min 1 s\", \"5 min 26 s\", \"5 min 29 s\")\n\nfootnotetext=\"T1w = T1-weighted; T2w = T2-weighted; pcASL = pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling; SWI = susceptibility weighted imaging; FSPG = fast spoiled gradient echo; CUBE = General Electric name of sequence, not an acronym; GRE = gradient echo; ZIP2 = through-plane zero filling interpolation\"\n\nif (knitr::is_latex_output()) {\ncolnames(df)[1] <- \"\"\ndf[11,] <- linebreak(df[11,])\ndf |>\n  kbl(format = \"latex\",\n    booktabs = TRUE,\n    longtable = TRUE,\n    linesep = \"\",\n    align = \"l\",\n    escape = FALSE) |>\n    kable_styling(font_size = 8, position = \"center\", latex_options = c(\"hold_position\", \"scale_down\"), full_width = FALSE) |>\n    footnote(general_title = \"\", \n           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE,\n           threeparttable = TRUE,\n           general = footnotetext) |>\n    column_spec(1, width=\"8em\") |>\n    column_spec(4, width=\"9em\") |>\n    column_spec(5, width=\"9em\")\n} else {\ndf |> \n    mutate(across(everything(), ~ str_replace_all(., \"\\n\", \"<br>\"))) |> \n    gt(rowname_col = \"Scan\") |> tab_footnote(footnotetext) |>\n    fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE) |>\n    tab_options(quarto.disable_processing = TRUE)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWarning in styling_latex_scale(out, table_info, \"down\"): Longtable cannot be\nresized.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{8}{10}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{ThreePartTable}\n\\begin{TableNotes}[para]\n\\item T1w = T1-weighted; T2w = T2-weighted; pcASL = pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling; SWI = susceptibility weighted imaging; FSPG = fast spoiled gradient echo; CUBE = General Electric name of sequence, not an acronym; GRE = gradient echo; ZIP2 = through-plane zero filling interpolation\n\\end{TableNotes}\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{8em}ll>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{9em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{9em}}\n\\toprule\n & T1w & T2w & pcASL & SWI\\\\\n\\midrule\nSequence & 3D FSPGR & 3D CUBE & Multi-shot 3D fast spin-echo & 3D spoiled GRE flow-compensated\\\\\nPhase-encoding direction & Coronal & Sagittal & Axial & Axial\\\\\nTR (ms) & 7.74 & 2,300 & 4,680 & 30.9\\\\\nTE (ms) & 2.97 & 66.29 & 10.55 & 5.24\\\\\nFlip angle & 12Â° & 90Â° & 111Â° & 20Â°\\\\\nFOV (cm) & 20 & 20 & 24 & 25\\\\\nAcquisition matrix & 512 x 512 & 256 x 256 & 128 x 128 & 256 x 256\\\\\nIn-plane resolution (mm) & 0.39 x 0.39 & 0.78 x 0.78 & 1.875 x 1.875 & 0.977 x 0.977\\\\\nSlice thickness (mm) & 1 & 1 & 4 & 2, reconstructed to 1 with zero filling (ZIP2)\\\\\nNumber of slices & 126 & 106 & 50 & 92\\\\\nAdditional parameters & n/a & n/a & 1,450 ms label period;\\newline  2,025 ms pulse label;\\newline  24 control-label pairs & n/a\\\\\nScan duration & 4 min 39 s & 5 min 1 s & 5 min 26 s & 5 min 29 s\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\insertTableNotes\n\\end{longtable}\n\\end{ThreePartTable}\n\\endgroup{}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MRI scan protocol comprised of the following sequences: a T1-weighted scan, a T2-weighted scan, a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) scan, a multi-echo susceptibility-weighted imaging scan, and a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) spin-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. The DWI sequence was not used for the present study.\n\n## Image analysis\n\nThe raw DICOM files acquired from the scanning procedure were converted to NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format using Chris Rordenâ€™s `dcmniix` tool. SWI magnitude data files were then used to create subject-specific brain masks that would not erode the SSS during QSM processing, an issue faced by our group in the past [@liFirstStepNeuroimaging2016]. A step-by-step summary of the pipeline used is shown in @fig-sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/Figures.ipynb#fig-graph >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the fifth echo SWI magnitude file was processed using FSLâ€™s (v. 6.0.7.3) [@woolrichBayesianAnalysisNeuroimaging2009] `fslroi`, `fslmaths`, and `bet` [@smithFastRobustAutomated2002] to create a preliminary brain mask, similar to our previous efforts, which does not contain the SSS. `Fslroi` was used to isolate the fifth echo of the magnitude data, which was then squared using Fslmaths and the option `-sqr`. Squaring the magnitude image was found to dramatically improve subsequent brain extraction. The resulting image was then used to create the preliminary brain mask using bet with the options `-m` and `-R`. The former flag generated a binary brain mask, while the latter performed a more robust brain centre estimation. The brain mask was then dilated by 7 voxels using `Fslmaths` and the options `-kernel boxv` and `-dilM` in order for the dilated mask to contain the SSS (along with unwanted tissue as well). This mask was then used, along with the phase images, in a MATLAB script for QSM calculation from Christian Kames [@kamesRapidTwostepDipole2018] to produce a preliminary QSM image that contained the SSS, albeit with fairly low signal-to-noise ratio and other unwanted tissue. Given the high contrast in voxel intensity between the SSS and surrounding tissue, the select by intensity tool in `FSLeyes` [@mccarthyFSLeyes2023] was then used to segment the SSS from the QSM image and create a 3D mask of the selected region. Using `fslmaths` and the options `-add` and `-bin`, the SSS mask was then combined with the original brain mask of the fifth echo. This resulted in a brain mask that contained only brain and SSS signal. Finally, this mask was used in a final QSM post-processing step to create a QSM image that includes the SSS while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio, making it suitable to obtain accurate susceptibility values.\n\nSTI Suite (v. 3.0) [@liIntegratedLaplacianBased2014], was used to process the final QSM images as it produced the cleanest images without eroding the SSS. The finalized brain mask and the last three echoes of the magnitude and phase images were used in STI Suite along with the following parameters: 0.9766 x 0.9766 x 1 mm^3^ voxel size, 5 ms TE1, 5.3 ms $\\Delta$TE, and 77.4 ms sum TE, B0 strength = 3, and B0 direction = \\[0, 0, 1\\]. The 3D GRE data option was selected for the phase processing stage, and STAR-QSM was selected for the QSM stage. Finally, the \\`select by intensity' tool in `FSLeyes` was then used to semi-automatically make vascular masks of the SSS and CCV from each subjectâ€™s QSM image. The vascular masks were used to calculate the mean susceptibility of each subjectâ€™s SSS and CCV from their QSM image with `fslstats`.\n\nTo isolate the paramagnetic component of subjectsâ€™ QSM data, the $\\chi$-separation toolbox [@shinHseparationMagneticSusceptibility2021] from the Laboratory for Imaging Science and Technology was used. Each subjectâ€™s magnitude and phase SWI data were used along with the following parameters: 0.9766 x 0.9766 x 1 mm^3^ voxel size; TE (s) = \\[0.005, 0.0102, 0.0155, 0.0207, 0.026\\]; delta TE (s) = 0.0052; B0 strength = 3; B0 direction = \\[0, 0, 1\\]. The mean susceptibility of each subjectâ€™s SSS and CCV in their paramagnetic maps was calculated with the same vascular masks used for the QSM images. Sample images showing the magnitude, final QSM, and final paramagnetic component images are shown in @fig-sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/Figures.ipynb#fig-sample >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the mean susceptibility values of the SSS and CCV were obtained from the subjectsâ€™ QSM images and paramagnetic maps, venous oxygen saturation (SvO~2~) was calculated with the following equation [@bergInvestigatingEffectFlow2021]:\n\n$$\nSvO_{2} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta \\chi _{blood} - (\\Delta \\chi _{oxy} * Hct)}{\\Delta \\chi _{do} * Hct}\n$$ {#eq-svo}\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\chi _{blood}$ is the vesselâ€™s measured susceptibility, $\\Delta \\chi _{oxy}$ is the constant representing the susceptibility changes of oxygenated blood relation to water, $\\Delta \\chi _{do}$ is the difference in susceptibility between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and Hct is the subjectâ€™s hematocrit. $\\Delta \\chi _{oxy}$ was -0.21 \\* 4$\\pi$ ppm as per @portnoyHumanUmbilicalCord2018 and [@sedlacikObtainingBloodOxygenation2007], while $\\Delta \\chi _{do}$ was -0.03 \\* 4$\\pi$ ppm as per [@weisskoffMRISusceptometryImagebased1992]. Subjectsâ€™ Hct for the day of the scan was calculated using a four-parameter Weibull function with previously measured values while still in the NICU.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis of the acquired data was performed using R and RStudio (v. 2023.09.1 Build 494) [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2022; @rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment]. Mean and standard deviation values are reported for most statistics, unless specified otherwise.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to test this in a neonatal cohort, as susceptibility separation has been typically evaluated as a method of imaging myelin and brain iron in adult subjects [@shinHseparationMagneticSusceptibility2021; @ahmedDiamagneticComponentMap2023a]. Our results showed that the SvO~2~ values of the SSS and CCV obtained from susceptibility separation are significantly lower than the respective SvO~2~ values obtained from QSM alone. When our results were compared to the literature, we found that our SSS SvO~2~ data from susceptibility separation agreed well with the findings of other studies measuring SvO~2~ of the SSS in similar subject populations. Conversely, the paramagnetic CCV SvO~2~ data saw less agreement with the existing literature than the corresponding data from QSM. However, there is reason to believe our paramagnetic CCV values may be accurate given their similarity to the paramagnetic SSS values and the limitations of the two studies that observed CCV SvO~2~.  Additionally, it is important to note that our SvO~2~ measurements from susceptibility separation had greater variance than our measurements from QSM, indicating a limitation that should be addressed in future research. Overall, the present work demonstrates the promise of susceptibility separation as an MRI post-processing technique that can measure the oxygenation of the cerebral veins of infant subjects, a useful marker of regional oxygen consumption in the brain. \n\n\n# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}\n\n# References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
