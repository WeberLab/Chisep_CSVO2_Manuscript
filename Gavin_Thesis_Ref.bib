  abstract = {A sensitive and accurate imaging technique capable of tracking the disease progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) driven amnestic dementia would be beneficial. A currently available method for pathology detection in AD with high accuracy is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, despite certain limitations such as low spatial resolution, off-targeting error, and radiation exposure. Non-invasive MRI scanning with quantitative magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used as a complementary tool. To date, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has widely been used in tracking deep gray matter iron accumulation in AD. The present work proposes that by compartmentalizing quantitative susceptibility into paramagnetic and diamagnetic components, more holistic information about AD pathogenesis can be acquired. Particularly, diamagnetic component susceptibility (DCS) can be a powerful indicator for tracking protein accumulation in the gray matter (GM), demyelination in the white matter (WM), and relevant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the current work, voxel-wise group analysis of the WM and the CSF regions show significantly lower {\textbar}DCS{\textbar} (the absolute value of DCS) value for amnestic dementia patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, {\textbar}DCS{\textbar} and {$\tau$} PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) were found to be associated in several GM regions typically affected by {$\tau$} deposition in AD. Therefore, we propose that the separated diamagnetic susceptibility can be used to track pathological neurodegeneration in different tissue types and regions of the brain. With the initial evidence, we believe the usage of compartmentalized susceptibility demonstrates substantive potential as an MRI-based technique for tracking AD-driven neurodegeneration.},

  abstract = {Background Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) may serve as biomarkers in several diseases. OEF and CMRO2 can be estimated from venous blood oxygenation (Yv) levels, which in turn can be calculated from venous blood T2 values (T2b). T2b can be measured using different MRI sequences, including T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and T2-prepared-blood-relaxation-imaging-with-inversion-recovery (T2-TRIR). The latter measures both T2b and T1 (T1b) but was found previously to overestimate T2b compared to TRUST. It remained unclear, however, if this bias is constant across higher and lower oxygen saturations. Purpose To compare TRUST and T2-TRIR across a range of O2 saturations using hypoxic and hypercapnic gas challenges. Study Type Prospective. Population Twelve healthy volunteers (four female, age 36 {\textpm} 10 years). Field Strength/Sequence A 3T; turbo-field echo-planar-imaging (TFEPI), echo-planar-imaging (EPI), and fast-field-echo (FFE). Assessment TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 were compared across different respiratory challenges. T1b from T2-TRIR was used to estimate Hct (HctTRIR) and compared with venipuncture (HctVP). Statistical Tests Shapiro--Wilk, one-sample and paired-sample t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman test, Bland--Altman, and correlation analysis. Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction was performed. Significance level was 0.05. Results A significant bias was observed between TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, and OEF values (-13 {\textpm} 11 msec, -5.3\% {\textpm} 3.5\% and 5.9 {\textpm} 4.1\%, respectively). For Yv and OEF, this bias was constant across the range of measured values. T1b was significantly lower during severe hypoxia and hypercapnia compared to baseline (1712 {\textpm} 86 msec and 1634 {\textpm} 79 msec compared to 1757 {\textpm} 90 msec). While no significant bias was found between HctVP and HctTRIR (0.02\% {\textpm} 0.06\%, P = 0.20), the correlation between these Hct values was significant but weak (r = 0.19). Data Conclusion Given the constant bias, TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived venous T2b values can be used interchangeably to estimate Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 across a broad range of oxygen saturations. Hct from T2-TRIR-derived T1-values only weakly correlated with Hct from venipuncture. Evidence Level 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 2.},

Recent decades brought significant progress in the instrumentation (e.g., miniaturized spectrometers) and spectral analysis methods (e.g., spectral image processing and analysis, quantum chemical calculation of NIR spectra), which made notable impact on its applicability. This review aims to present NIR spectroscopy as a matured technique, yet with great potential for further advances in several directions throughout broadly understood bio-applications.

Many clinical research studies of infants born preterm limit their outcomes to neonatal mortality and morbidity. Complications and the disturbance of normal development may result from factors that influence prenatal development and the etiology of preterm birth, but the extent to which this happens is often unknown. Although this chapter is by no means a complete catalog of complications of preterm birth, this chapter discusses how these various complications reflect immaturity; the impact that they have on survival, organ maturation, and health; and the efficacies of a number of intervention strategies designed to prevent and mitigate the effects of these complications. As outlined in Chapter 2, information based on gestational age is preferred over information based on birth weight because of the value of knowledge of gestation age in making decisions regarding preterm delivery and prenatal counseling of the parent.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a promising non-invasive method for obtaining information relating to the oxygen metabolism. However, the optimal acquisition sequence and QSM reconstruction method for reliable venous susceptibility measurements are unknown. Full flow compensation is generally recommended to correct for the influence of venous blood flow, although the effect of flow compensation on the accuracy of venous susceptibility values has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effect of different acquisition sequences, including different flow compensation schemes, and different QSM reconstruction methods on venous susceptibilities. Ten healthy subjects were scanned with five or six distinct QSM sequence designs implementing different flow compensation schemes. All data sets were processed using six different QSM pipelines and venous blood susceptibility was evaluated in whole-brain segmentations of the venous vasculature and single veins. The quality of vein segmentations and the accuracy of venous susceptibility values were analyzed and compared between all combinations of sequences and QSM methods. The influence of the QSM method on average venous susceptibility values was found to be 2.7 - 11.6 times greater than the influence of the acquisition sequence, including flow compensation. The majority of the investigated QSM reconstruction methods tended to underestimate venous susceptibility values in the vein segmentations that were obtained. Using multi-echo gradient-echo acquisitions with monopolar readout gradients, we found that sequences without full flow compensation yielded venous susceptibility values comparable to sequences with full flow compensation. However, the QSM method had a great influence on susceptibility values and thus needs to be considered carefully for accurate venous QSM.},

The first section is devoted to describing blood magnetic susceptibility and its effect on the MRI signal. Blood circulating in the vasculature can have diamagnetic (oxyhemoglobin) or paramagnetic properties (deoxyhemoglobin). The overall balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin determines the induced magnetic field which, in turn, modulates the transverse relaxation decay of the MRI signal via additional phase accumulation. The following sections of this review then illustrate the principles underpinning susceptibility-based techniques for quantifying OEF and CMRO2. Here, it is detailed whether these techniques provide global (OxFlow) or local (Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping - QSM, calibrated BOLD - cBOLD, quantitative BOLD - qBOLD, QSM+qBOLD) measurements of OEF or CMRO2, and what signal components (magnitude or phase) and tissue pools they consider (intravascular or extravascular). Validations studies and potential limitations of each method are also described. The latter include (but are not limited to) challenges in the experimental setup, the accuracy of signal modeling, and assumptions on the measured signal. The last section outlines the clinical uses of these techniques in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases and contextualizes these reports relative to results from gold-standard PET.},

  abstract = {Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular anomalies characterized by arteriovenous shunting through a network of coiled and tortuous vessels. Because of this anatomy, the venous drainage of an AVM is hypothesized to contain more oxygenated, arterialized blood than healthy veins. By exploiting the paramagnetic properties of deoxygenated hemoglobin in venous blood using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), we aimed to explore venous density and oxygen saturation (SvO2) in patients with a brain AVM. We considered three groups of subjects: patients with a brain AVM before treatment using gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR); patients three or more years post-GKR treatment; and healthy volunteers. First, we investigated the appearance of AVMs on QSM images. Then, we investigated whether QSM could detect increased SvO2 in the veins draining the malformations. In patients before GKR, venous density, but not SvO2, was significantly larger in the hemisphere containing the AVM compared to the contralateral hemisphere (p\,=\,0.03). Such asymmetry was not observed in patients after GKR or in healthy volunteers. Moreover, in all patients before GKR, the vein immediately draining the AVM nidus had a higher SvO2 than healthy veins. Therefore, QSM can be used to detect SvO2 alterations in brain AVMs. However, since factors such as flow-induced signal dephasing or the presence of hemosiderin deposits also strongly affect QSM image contrast, AVM vein segmentation must be performed based on alternative MRI acquisitions, e.g., time of flight magnetic resonance angiography or T1-weighted images. This is the first study to show, non-invasively, that AVM draining veins have a significantly larger SvO2 than healthy veins, which is a finding congruent with arteriovenous shunting.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a means to obtain direct measurements of local tissue susceptibility distribution. Usually the focus is on imaging tissues in the brain, and the region of the brain studied is dictated by an eroded skull stripped mask. Producing the pristine local phase behavior for regions at the edge of the brain has been difficult in the past. For structures such as the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) that run alongside the surface of the brain and under the skull bones, a considerable part of the external phase from the dipole effect is lost due to the short T2* of the bones. In this paper, we propose a method that seeks to reconstruct the susceptibility distribution inside the dural sinuses by ensuring that the entire geometry of the dural sinuses is preserved with the help of an MR angiogram and venogram (MRAV). Having a geometrical model of the vessels makes it possible to estimate the missing phase outside the brain as well, by using the forward phase model and, hence, allowing a complete phase map to be reconstructed. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned using a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence with interleaved rephaseddephased echoes. QSM results were compared between the conventional techniques and the proposed method of phase preservation outside the brain and inside the dural sinuses. This method demonstrates the reconstruction of the SSS, whereas conventional methods are either unable to preserve this structure or unable to provide complete phase information. The mean and standard deviation inside the SSS for all volunteers was 435 {\textpm} 5 ppb (this is the inter-subject error). To validate the proposed approach, the mean susceptibility inside the straight sinus showed good agreement between conventional approach and the proposed method. The results presented in this study indicate the potential of generating the susceptibility map for the whole brain, including the SSS (as well as potentially all the cortical veins).},

  abstract = {Iron is a key nutrient for normal central nervous system (CNS) development and function; thus, iron deficiency as well as iron excess may result in harmful effects in the CNS. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are crucial players in brain iron equilibrium. However, the mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes during CNS development or under pathological situations such as demyelination are not completely understood. In the CNS, iron is directly required for myelin production as a cofactor for enzymes involved in ATP, cholesterol and lipid synthesis, and oligodendrocytes are the cells with the highest iron levels in the brain which is linked to their elevated metabolic needs associated with the process of myelination. Unlike oligodendrocytes, astrocytes do not have a high metabolic requirement for iron. However, these cells are in close contact with blood vessel and have a strong iron transport capacity. In several pathological situations, changes in iron homoeostasis result in altered cellular iron distribution and accumulation and oxidative stress. In inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, reactive astrocytes accumulate iron and upregulate iron efflux and influx molecules, which suggest that they are outfitted to take up and safely recycle iron. In this review, we will discuss the participation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in CNS iron homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is necessary for planning effective strategies for iron management during CNS development as well as for the treatment of demyelinating diseases.},

With the recently introduced method of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and its conceptual extension to susceptibility tensor imaging (STI), the non-invasive assessment of this important physical quantity has become possible with MRI. Both methods solve the ill-posed inverse problem to determine the magnetic susceptibility from local magnetic fields. Whilst QSM allows the extraction of the spatial distribution of the bulk magnetic susceptibility from a single measurement, STI enables the quantification of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, but requires multiple measurements with different orientations of the object relative to the main static magnetic field. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the fundamental theoretical foundation of QSM and STI, as well as computational strategies for the characterization of magnetic susceptibility with MRI phase data. In the second part, we provide an overview of current methodological and clinical applications of QSM with a focus on brain imaging. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Brain oxygen consumption reflects neuronal activity and can therefore be used to investigate brain development or neuronal injury in neonates. In this paper we present the first results of a non-invasive MRI method to evaluate whole brain oxygen consumption in neonates. Materials and methods For this study 51 neonates were included. The T1 and T2 of blood in the sagittal sinus were fitted using the `T2 prepared tissue relaxation inversion recovery' pulse sequence (T2-TRIR). From the T1 and the T2 of blood, the venous oxygenation and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were calculated. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) was the resultant of the venous oxygenation and arterial spin labeling whole brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements. Results Venous oxygenation was 59{\textpm}14\% (mean{\textpm}sd), OEF was 40{\textpm}14\%, CBF was 14{\textpm}5ml/100g/min and CMRO2 was 30{\textpm}12{$\mu$}mol/100g/min. The OEF in preterms at term-equivalent age was higher than in the preterms and in the infants with hypoxic--ischemic encephalopathy (p{$<$}0.01). The OEF, CBF and CMRO2 increased (p{$<$}0.01, {$<$}0.05 and {$<$}0.01, respectively) with postnatal age. Conclusion We presented an MRI technique to evaluate whole-brain oxygen consumption in neonates non-invasively. The measured values are in line with reference values found by invasive measurement techniques. Preterms and infants with HIE demonstrated significant lower oxygen extraction fraction than the preterms at term-equivalent age. This could be due to decreased neuronal activity as a reflection of brain development or as a result of tissue damage, increased cerebral blood flow due to immature or impaired autoregulation, or could be caused by differences in postnatal age.},

  abstract = {Increased iron in subcortical gray matter (GM) structures of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) has been suggested as a causal factor in neuronal degeneration. But how iron content is related to white matter (WM) changes in HD is still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether WM changes share the same physiopathology (i.e. iron accumulation) with GM or whether there is a different mechanism. The present study used MRI to examine iron content in premanifest gene carriers (PreHD, n = 25) and in early HD patients (n = 25) compared with healthy controls (n = 50). 3T MRI acquisitions included high resolution 3D T1, EPI sequences for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an indirect measure of tissue integrity, and T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging for MR-based relaxometry (R2*), which provides an indirect measure of ferritin/iron deposition in the brain. Myelin breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, but there is no difference in iron content values. Iron content reduction manifests later, in the early HD stage, in which we found a lower R2* parameter value in the isthmus. The WM iron reduction in HD is temporally well-defined (no iron differences in PreHD subjects and iron differences only in early HD patients). Iron level in callosal WM may be regarded as a marker of disease state, as iron does not differentiate PreHD subjects from controls but distinguishes between PreHD and HD.

Therefore, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) monitoring with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is of added value in neonatal intensive care. rScO2 represents oxygen supply to the brain, while cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction, which is the ratio between rScO2 and systemic arterial oxygen saturation, reflects cerebral oxygen utilization. The balance between oxygen supply and utilization provides insight in neonatal cerebral (patho-)physiology. This review highlights the potential and limitations of cerebral oxygenation monitoring with NIRS in the neonatal intensive care unit.}

Despite this optimistic trend, preterm birth rates remain higher in the USA, where nearly one in every eight infants is born early, compared to other developed countries. The prevention of preterm birth is considered a public health priority because of the potential to reduce infant and childhood morbidity and mortality related to this condition. Unfortunately, progress has been modest. One of the greatest challenges in studying this outcome is that preterm birth is a complex condition resulting from multiple etiologic pathways. Recently, experts have developed innovative frameworks for classifying and studying preterm birth based on phenotype.

  abstract = {Beta amyloid is a protein fragment snipped from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aggregation of these peptides into amyloid plaques is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. MR imaging of beta amyloid plaques has been attempted using various techniques, notably with T2* contrast. The non-invasive detectability of beta amyloid plaques in MR images has so far been largely attributed to focal iron deposition accompanying the plaques. It is believed that the T2* shortening effects of paramagnetic iron are the primary source of contrast between plaques and surrounding tissue. Amyloid plaque itself has been reported to induce no magnetic susceptibility effect. We hypothesized that aggregations of beta amyloid would increase electron density and induce notable changes in local susceptibility value, large enough to generate contrast relative to surrounding normal tissues that can be visualized by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MR imaging. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated in a phantom that beta amyloid is diamagnetic and can generate strong contrast on susceptibility maps. We then conducted experiments on a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that is known to mimic the formation of human beta amyloid but without neurofibrillary tangles or neuronal death. Over a period of 18 months, we showed that QSM can be used to longitudinally monitor beta amyloid accumulation and accompanied iron deposition in vivo. Individual beta amyloid plaque can also be visualized ex vivo in high resolution susceptibility maps. Moreover, the measured negative susceptibility map and positive susceptibility map could provide histology-like image contrast for identifying deposition of beta amyloid plaques and iron. Finally, we demonstrated that the diamagnetic susceptibility of beta amyloid can also be observed in brain specimens of AD patients. The ability to assess beta amyloid aggregation non-invasively with QSM MR imaging may aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Objective Cerebral venous oxygenation (Yv) is a key parameter for the brain's oxygen utilization and has been suggested to be a valuable biomarker in various brain diseases including hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in neonates and Alzheimer's disease in older adults. T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI is a widely used technique to measure global Yv level and has been validated against gold-standard PET. However, subject motion during TRUST MRI scan can introduce considerable errors in Yv quantification, especially for noncompliant subjects. The aim of this study was to develop an Automatic Rejection based on Tissue Signal (ARTS) algorithm for automatic detection and exclusion of motion-contaminated images to improve the precision of Yv quantification. Methods TRUST MRI data were collected from a neonatal cohort (N~=~37, 16 females, gestational age~=~39.12~{\textpm}~1.11~weeks, postnatal age~=~1.89~{\textpm}~0.74~days) and an older adult cohort (N~=~223, 134 females, age~=~68.02~{\textpm}~9.01~years). Manual identification of motion-corrupted images was conducted for both cohorts to serve as a gold-standard. 9.3\% of the images in the neonatal datasets and 0.4\% of the images in the older adult datasets were manually identified as motion-contaminated. The ARTS algorithm was trained using the neonatal datasets. TRUST Yv values, as well as the estimation uncertainty ({$\Delta$}R2) and test-retest coefficient-of-variation (CoV) of Yv, were calculated with and without ARTS motion exclusion. The ARTS algorithm was tested on datasets of older adults: first on the original adult datasets with little motion, and then on simulated adult datasets where the percentage of motion-corrupted images matched that of the neonatal datasets. Results In the neonatal datasets, the ARTS algorithm exhibited a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.97 in detecting motion-contaminated images. Compared to no motion exclusion, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 (median~=~3.68~Hz vs. 4.89~Hz, P~=~0.0002) and CoV (median~=~2.57\% vs. 6.87\%, P~=~0.0005) of Yv measurements. In the original older adult datasets, the sensitivity and specificity of ARTS were 0.70 and 1.00, respectively. In the simulated adult datasets, ARTS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 1.00. Additionally, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 compared to no motion exclusion (median~=~2.15~Hz vs. 3.54~Hz, P~{$<~$}0.0001). Conclusion ARTS can improve the reliability of Yv estimation in noncompliant subjects, which may enhance the utility of Yv as a biomarker for brain diseases.},

  abstract = {Purpose To create an orientation independent, three dimensional reconstruction of the veins in the brain using susceptibility mapping. Materials and Methods High resolution, high pass filtered phase images usually used for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) were used as a source for local magnetic field behavior. These images were subsequently post-processed using an inverse procedure to generate susceptibility maps of the veins. Regularization and interpolation of the data in k-space of the phase images were used to reduce reconstruction artifacts. To understand the effects of artifacts, and to fine tune the methodology, simulations of blood vessels were performed with and without noise. Results With sufficient resolution, major veins in the brain could be visualized with this approach. The usual geometry dependent phase dipole effects are removed by this processing, leaving basically images of the veins. Different sized vessels show a different level of contrast depending on their partial volume effects. Vessels that are 8mm or 16 mm in size show quantitative values expected for normal oxygen saturation levels. Smaller vessels show smaller values due to errors in the methodology and due to partial volume effects. Larger vessels show a bias toward a reduced susceptibility approaching 90\% of the expected value. Limitations of the method and artifacts related to different sources of errors are demonstrated. Conclusion Susceptibility maps can successfully create venograms of the brain with varying levels of contrast-to-noise depending on the size of the vessel. Partial volume effects render this approach more useful as an imaging tool or a visualization tool although certain larger vessels have measured susceptibilities close to expected values associated with normal blood oxygen saturation levels.},

  abstract = {Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO2 in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO2) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO2 (CMRO2i) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O2/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO2 values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global SvO2, CBF, and CMRO2 with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R2=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

This study aims to develop a rapid method for vessel-specific measurement of Yv in neonates. Methods: We developed a pulse sequence, named accelerated T2-relaxation-under-phase-contrast (aTRUPC), which consists of velocity-encoding phase-contrast module to isolate pure blood signal, flow-insensitive T2-preparation to quantify blood T2, and turbo-field-echo (TFE) scheme for rapid image acquisition, which is critical for neonatal MRI. A series of studies were conducted. First, the pulse sequence was optimized in terms of TFE factor, velocity encoding (VENC), and slice thickness for best sensitivity. Second, to account for the influence of TFE acquisition on T2 quantification, simulation and experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between TFE-T2 and standard T2. Finally, the complete aTRUPC sequence was applied on a group of healthy neonates and normative Yv values were determined. Results: Optimal parameters of aTRUPC in neonates were found to be a TFE factor of 15, VENC of 5cm/s, and slice thickness of 10mm. TFE-T2 was on average 3.9\% lower than standard T2. These two measures were strongly correlated (R2=0.86), thus their difference can be accounted for by a correction equation, T2,standard=1.2002{\texttimes}T2,TFE-10.6276. Neonatal Yv values in veins draining cortical brain and those draining central brain were 64.8{\textpm}2.9\% and 70.2{\textpm}3.3\%, respectively, with a significant difference (P=0.02). Conclusion: aTRUPC MRI has the potential to provide vessel-specific quantification of cerebral Yv in neonates.},

Methods Following feasibility demonstration, several technical aspects were examined, including validation with an established global Yv technique, test-retest reproducibility, sensitivity to detect oxygenation changes due to hypoxia and caffeine challenges, applicability of EPI acquisition to shorten scan duration, and ability to study veins with a caliber of 1--2 mm. Results TRU-PC was able to simultaneously measure Yv in all major veins in the brain, including sagittal sinus, straight sinus, great vein, and internal cerebral vein. TRU-PC results showed an excellent agreement with the reference technique, high sensitivity to oxygenation changes, and test-retest variability of 3.5{\textpm}1.0\%. The use of segmented-EPI was able to reduce the scan duration to 1.5 minutes. It was also feasible to study pial veins and deep veins.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

  abstract = {Background  The underlying brain structural changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have attracted increasing attention. The insulin-resistant state causes iron overload in neurons and leads to lesions in the central nervous system. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can provide a noninvasive quantitative analysis of brain iron deposition. We aimed to compare the difference of brain iron deposition in the gray matter nucleus between T2DM patients and healthy elderly individuals using QSM.  Methods  Thirty-two T2DM patients and thirty-two age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this research. Twenty-three patients and twenty-six HCs underwent cognitive assessments. Brain QSM maps were computed from multiecho GRE data using morphology-enabled dipole inversion with automatic uniform cerebrospinal fluid zero reference algorithm (MEDI+0). ITK-SNAP was used to measure the susceptibility values reflecting the content of iron in the regions of interest (ROIs).  Results  The study included thirty-two T2DM patients (20 males and 12 females; mean age of 61.09 {\textpm} 9.99 years) and 32 HCs (14 males and 18 females; mean age of 59.09 {\textpm} 9.77 years). These participants had no significant difference in age or gender (P {$>$} 0.05). Twenty-three patients with T2DM (11 males and 12 females; mean age, 64.65 {\textpm} 8.44 years) and twenty-six HCs (14 males and 12 females; mean age, 62.30 {\textpm} 6.13 years) received an assessment of cognitive function. T2DM patients exhibited an obviously (t = 3.237, P = 0.003) lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (26.78 {\textpm} 2.35; HCs, 28.42 {\textpm} 0.64; normal standard {$\geq$}26) and a higher Stroop color-word test (SCWT)-C score [87(65,110); HC, 63(60,76.75), Z = -2.232, P = 0.003] than HCs. The mean susceptibility values in the putamen appeared obviously higher in T2DM patients than in HCs (t = -3.994, P {$<$} 0.001). The susceptibility values and cognitive assessment scores showed no obvious association (P {$>$} 0.05). However, an obvious correlation was observed between the changes in the susceptibility values in the putamen and the thalamus/dentate nucleus (r = 0.404, P {$<$} 0.001; r = 0.423, P {$<$} 0.001).  Conclusion  T2DM patients showed increased susceptibility values in the putamen and had declines in executive functions, but the linear association between them was not statistically significant. Changes in susceptibility values in the putamen indicated increased iron deposition and might be used as a quantitative imaging marker of central nervous system injury in T2DM patients. QSM might be able to help probe micro neuronal damage in gray matter and provide information on diabetic encephalopathy.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed MRI technique that provides a quantitative measure of tissue magnetic susceptibility. To compute tissue magnetic susceptibilities based on gradient echoes, QSM requires reliable unwrapping of the measured phase images and removal of contributions caused by background susceptibilities. Typically, the two steps are performed separately. Here, we present a method that simultaneously performs phase unwrapping and HARmonic (background) PhasE REmovaL using the LAplacian operator (HARPERELLA). Both numerical simulations and               in vivo               human brain images show that HARPERELLA effectively removes both phase wraps and background phase, whilst preserving all low spatial frequency components originating from brain tissues. When compared with other QSM phase preprocessing techniques, such as path-based phase unwrapping followed by background phase removal, HARPERELLA preserves the tissue phase signal in gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid with excellent robustness, providing a convenient and accurate solution for QSM. The proposed algorithm is provided, together with QSM and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) tools, in a shared software package named `STI Suite'.

Phase imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for the investigation of functional brain anatomy and disease diagnosis. However, the quantitative value of phase is compromised by its nonlocal and orientation dependent properties. There is an increasing need for reliable quantification of magnetic susceptibility, the intrinsic property of tissue. In this study, we developed a novel and accurate susceptibility mapping method that is also phase-wrap insensitive. The proposed susceptibility mapping method utilized two complementary equations: (1) the Fourier relationship of phase and magnetic susceptibility; and (2) the first-order partial derivative of the first equation in the spatial frequency domain. In numerical simulation, this method reconstructed the susceptibility map almost free of streaking artifact. Further, the iterative implementation of this method allowed for high quality reconstruction of susceptibility maps of human brain in vivo. The reconstructed susceptibility map provided excellent contrast of iron-rich deep nuclei and white matter bundles from surrounding tissues. Further, it also revealed anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in brain white matter. Hence, the proposed susceptibility mapping method may provide a powerful tool for the study of brain physiology and pathophysiology. Further elucidation of anisotropic magnetic susceptibility in vivo may allow us to gain more insight into the white matter micro-architectures.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for quantifying the spatial distribution of magnetic susceptibility within biological tissues. It first uses the frequency shift in the MRI signal to map the magnetic field profile within the tissue. The resulting field map is then used to determine the spatial distribution of the underlying magnetic susceptibility by solving an inverse problem. The solution is achieved by deconvolving the field map with a dipole field, under the assumption that the magnetic field results from a superposition of the dipole fields generated by all voxels and that each voxel has its own unique magnetic susceptibility. QSM provides an improved contrast-to-noise ratio for certain tissues and structures compared with its magnitude counterpart. More importantly, magnetic susceptibility directly reflects the molecular composition and cellular architecture of the tissue. Consequently, by quantifying magnetic susceptibility, QSM is becoming a quantitative imaging approach for characterizing normal and pathological tissue properties.

  abstract = {Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose Cerebral tissue oxygenation is a critical brain viability parameter, and the magnetic properties of hemoglobin offer the opportunity to noninvasively quantify oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrahigh-field MRI shows advantages such as increased sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility differences and improved signal-to-noise ratio that can be translated into smaller voxel size, but also increased sensitivity to static and B1 field inhomogeneities. The aim was to produce a systematic comparison of three MRI-based methods for estimation of OEF. Methods OEF estimates in 16 healthy subjects were obtained at 7T utilizing susceptometry-based oximetry (SBO), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). Two major draining veins, that is, the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the straight sinus (SS), were investigated, including mutual agreement between the methods in each of the two different vessels, agreement between vessels as well as potential vessel angle and vessel size dependences. Results Very good correlation (r~=~.88) was found between SBO-based and QSM-based OEF estimates in SSS. Only QSM showed a moderate correlation (r~=~.61) between corresponding OEF estimates in SSS and SS. For SBO, a trend of increasing OEF estimates was observed as the SS vessel angle relative to the main magnetic field increased. No obvious size dependence could be established for any method. The R2*-based OEF estimates were reasonable (35\%-36\%), but the observed range was somewhat low. Conclusion The results indicate that QSM is a promising candidate for assessment of OEF estimates, for example, providing reasonably robust estimates across a wide range of vessel orientations.},

Method In a prospective cohort of 193 neonates born preterm, 24 to 32 weeks' gestation, we used magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging acquired early in life (n=193) and at term-equivalent age (n=159) to measure corpus callosum development: mid-sagittal area (including corpus callosum subdivisions) and length, and fractional anisotropy from the genu and splenium. We examined the association of (1) intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and white matter injury (WMI) severity, and (2) neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age with corpus callosum development. Results Severe WMI and severe IVH were strongly associated with reduced corpus callosum area (both p{$<$}0.001) and WMI with lower fractional anisotropy (p=0.002). Mild WMI predicted smaller corpus callosum area only posteriorly; mild IVH predicted smaller area throughout. Adverse motor outcome was associated with smaller corpus callosum size in the posterior subdivision (p=0.003). Abnormal cognitive outcomes were associated with lower corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (p=0.008). Interpretation In newborn infants born very preterm, brain injury is associated with changes in simple metrics of corpus callosum development. In this population, the development of the corpus callosum, as reflected by size and microstructure, is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months corrected age.},

Iron plays an important role in many neurodevelopmental processes, and animal studies suggest that iron sufficiency in pregnancy and infancy is particularly important for neurodevelopment. However, it is not clear whether iron deficiency directly impacts developmental outcomes, and, if so, whether impact differs by timing of exposure or developmental domain. We searched four databases for studies on iron deficiency or iron supplementation in pregnancy, or at 0--6 months, 6--24 months, or 2--4 years of age. All studies included neurodevelopmental assessments in infants or children up to 4 years old. We then qualitatively synthesized the literature. There was no clear relationship between iron status and developmental outcomes across any of the time windows or domains included. We identified a large quantity of low-quality studies, significant heterogeneity in study design and a lack of research focused on pregnancy and early infancy. In summary, despite good mechanistic evidence for the role of iron in brain development, evidence for the impact of iron deficiency or iron supplementation on early development is inconsistent. Further high-quality research is needed, particularly within pregnancy and early infancy, which has previously been neglected.},

Methods: SvO2 measurements using T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and susceptibility-based oximetry (SBO) were performed in 13 healthy subjects under room air, hypoxia and hypercapnia conditions. Agreement between TRUST and SBO was quantitatively evaluated. In two of the subjects, TRUST and SBO were compared against the clinical gold standard, co-oximeter measurement via internal jugular vein catheterization. Results: Absolute SvO2 measurements using TRUST and SBO were highly correlated across a range of saturations from 45 to 84\% (Pearson r = 0.91, P {$<$} 0.0001). SvO2-TRUST was significantly lower than SvO2-SBO under hypoxia and room air conditions, but the two were comparable under hypercapnia. TRUST demonstrated a larger SvO2 increase under hypercapnia than SBO. TRUST had good agreement with jugular catheterization under hypercapnia but significantly underestimated SvO2 under room air and hypoxia. The agreement between SvO2-SBO and the reference did not depend on the physiological state. Conclusion: A systematic bias was observed between T2- and susceptibility-based methods that depended on the oxygenation state. In-vivo validation with jugular catheterization indicated potential underestimation of TRUST under room air and hypoxia conditions. Our findings suggested that caution should be taken for comparison of absolute SvO2 measurements using either TRUST or SBO.},

T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) is an MRI technique which has revealed changes in Yv in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, prior studies comparing Yv in patients with SCA relative to healthy controls have reported opposing results depending on whether the calibration model, developed to convert blood T2 to Yv, is based on healthy human hemoglobin (HbA), bovine hemoglobin (HbBV) or sickle hemoglobin (HbS). MRI Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an alternative technique that may hold promise for estimating Yv in SCA as blood magnetic susceptibility is linearly dependent upon Yv, and no significant difference has been found between the magnetic susceptibility of HbA and HbS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare estimates of Yv using QSM and TRUST with five published calibration models in healthy controls and patients with SCA. 17 patients with SCA and 13 healthy controls underwent MRI. Susceptibility maps were calculated from a multi-parametric mapping acquisition and Yv was calculated from the mean susceptibility in a region of interest in the superior sagittal sinus. TRUST estimates of T2, within a similar but much smaller region, were converted to Yv using five different calibration models. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed to compare estimates of Yv between TRUST and QSM methods. For each method, t-tests were also used to explore group-wise differences between patients with SCA and healthy controls. In healthy controls, significant correlations were observed between QSM and TRUST measures of Yv, while in SCA, there were no such correlations. The magnitude and direction of group-wise differences in Yv varied with method. The TRUST-HbBV and QSM methods suggested decreased Yv in SCA relative to healthy controls, while the TRUST-HbS (p {$<$} 0.01) and TRUST-HbA models suggested increased Yv in SCA as in previous studies. Further validation of all MRI measures of Yv, relative to ground truth measures such as O15 PET and jugular vein catheterization, is required in SCA before QSM or TRUST methods can be considered for neurological risk prediction.}

Oximetry is a technique for the assessment of blood oxygenation by measurements of light transmission through the blood, which is based on the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood provides information on the adequacy of respiration and is routinely measured in clinical settings, utilizing pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation, in venous blood (SvO2) and in the entire blood in a tissue (StO2), is related to the blood supply to the tissue, and several oximetric techniques have been developed for their assessment. SvO2 can be measured non-invasively in the fingers, making use of modified pulse oximetry, and in the retina, using the modified Beer-Lambert Law. StO2 is measured in peripheral muscle and cerebral tissue by means of various modes of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), utilizing the relative transparency of infrared light in muscle and cerebral tissue. The primary problem of oximetry is the discrimination between absorption by hemoglobin and scattering by tissue elements in the attenuation measurement, and the various techniques developed for isolating the absorption effect are presented in the current review, with their limitations.},

METHODS: We systematically searched population-based, nationally representative data on preterm birth from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2020 and study data (26 March-14 April, 2021) for countries and areas with no national-level data. The analysis included 679 data points (86\% nationally representative administrative data [582 of 679 data points]) from 103 countries and areas (62\% of countries and areas having nationally representative administrative data [64 of 103 data points]). A Bayesian hierarchical regression was used for estimating country-level preterm rates, which incoporated country-specific intercepts, low birthweight as a covariate, non-linear time trends, and bias adjustments based on a data quality categorisation, and other indicators such as method of gestational age estimation. FINDINGS: An estimated 13{$\cdot$}4 million (95\% credible interval [CrI] 12{$\cdot$}3-15{$\cdot$}2 million) newborn babies were born preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) in 2020 (9{$\cdot$}9\% of all births [95\% CrI 9{$\cdot$}1-11{$\cdot$}2]) compared with 13{$\cdot$}8 million (12{$\cdot$}7-15{$\cdot$}5 million) in 2010 (9{$\cdot$}8\% of all births [9{$\cdot$}0-11{$\cdot$}0]) worldwide. The global annual rate of reduction was estimated at -0{$\cdot$}14\% from 2010 to 2020. In total, 55{$\cdot$}6\% of total livebirths are in southern Asia (26{$\cdot$}8\% [36\hphantom{,}099\hphantom{,}000 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]) and sub-Saharan Africa (28{$\cdot$}7\% [38\hphantom{,}819\hphantom{,}300 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]), yet these two regions accounted for approximately 65\% (8\hphantom{,}692\hphantom{,}000 of 13\hphantom{,}376\hphantom{,}200) of all preterm births globally in 2020. Of the 33 countries and areas in the highest data quality category, none were in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa compared with 94\% (30 of 32 countries) in high-income countries and areas. Worldwide from 2010 to 2020, approximately 15\% of all preterm births occurred at less than 32 weeks of gestation, requiring more neonatal care ({$<$}28 weeks: 4{$\cdot$}2\%, 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}1-5{$\cdot$}0, 567\hphantom{,}800 [410\hphantom{,}200-663\hphantom{,}200 newborn babies]); 28-32 weeks: 10{$\cdot$}4\% [9{$\cdot$}5-10{$\cdot$}6], 1\hphantom{,}392\hphantom{,}500 [1\hphantom{,}274\hphantom{,}800-1\hphantom{,}422\hphantom{,}600 newborn babies]). INTERPRETATION: There has been no measurable change in preterm birth rates over the last decade at global level. Despite increasing facility birth rates and substantial focus on routine health data systems, there remain many missed opportunities to improve preterm birth data. Gaps in national routine data for preterm birth are most marked in regions of southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which also have the highest estimated burden of preterm births. Countries need to prioritise programmatic investments to prevent preterm birth and to ensure evidence-based quality care when preterm birth occurs. Investments in improving data quality are crucial so that preterm birth data can be improved and used for action and accountability processes.

  abstract = {The human brain develops rapidly during 32-45 postmenstrual weeks (PMW), a critical stage characterized by dramatic increases of metabolic demand. The increasing metabolic demand can be inferred through measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), which might be coupled to regional metabolism in preterm brains. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is one of the few viable approaches for imaging regional CBF of preterm brains, but must be optimized for the extremely slow blood velocity unique in preterm brains. In this study, we explored the spatiotemporal CBF distribution in newborns scanned at the age of 32-45PMW using a pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) protocol adapted to slow blood flow in neonates. A total of 89 neonates were recruited. PCASL MRI was acquired from 34 normal newborns and phase contrast (PC) images from 19 newborns. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) were acquired from all 89 neonates for measuring cortical fractional anisotropy (FA), which characterizes cortical microstructure. Reproducible CBF measurements were obtained with the adjusted pCASL sequence. Global CBF measurement based on PC MRI was found to double its value in the 3rd trimester. Regional CBF increases were heterogeneous across the brain with a significantly higher rate of CBF increase in the frontal lobe and a lower rate of CBF increase in the occipital lobe. A significant correlation was found between frontal cortical CBF and cortical FA measurements (p{$<$}0.01). Increasing CBF values observed in the frontal lobe corresponded to lower FA values, suggesting that dendritic arborization and synaptic formation might be associated with an elevated local CBF. These results offer a preliminary account of heterogeneous regional CBF increases in a vital early developmental period and may shed the light on underlying metabolic support for cortical microstructural changes during the developmental period of 32-45PMW. Preterm effects and limitations of pCASL techniques in newborns need to be carefully considered for interpretation these results.},

  abstract = {The brain's hemodynamic and metabolism of punctate white matter lesions (PWML) is poorly understood due to a scarcity of non-invasive imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to apply new MRI techniques to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), global cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation fractions in venous blood (Yv) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in neonates with PWML, for better understanding of the pathophysiology of PWML. Fifty-one newborns were recruited continuously, including 23 neonatal patients with PWML and 28 normal control neonates. Phase-contrast (PC) MRI and T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI were performed for the measurement of CBF and Yv. OEF and CMRO2 were calculated from the CBF and Yv values. The total maturation score (TMS) was assessed for each neonate on standard T1, 2-weighted images to evaluate cerebral maturation. The CMRO2, CBF, Yv, and OEF values were compared between groups, and their associations with age and TMS were evaluated. Significant differences between PWML group and control group were found in CMRO2 (P = 0.020), CBF (P = 0.027), Yv (P = 0.012), OEF (P = 0.018). After age/maturation is accounted for, Yv and OEF showed significant dependence on the groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Newborns with PWML had lower OEF and higher Yv. CMRO2, CBF and brain volume were correlated with age (P {$<$} 0.001) and TMS (P {$<$} 0.05). It is feasible to use non-invasive MRI methods to measure cerebral oxygen supply and consumption in neonates with PWML. Newborns with PWML have lower oxygen consumption. Yv and OEF may be helpful for the diagnosis of PWML. The positive correlation between CBF and TMS, and between CMRO2 and TMS suggested that as myelination progresses, the blood supply and oxygen metabolism in the brain increase to meet the escalating energy demand.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (ScvO2) is considered a gold standard in assessing the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery (DO2) after the stage 1 palliation (S1P), with SvO2~{$<$}30\% often representing severely compromised DO2. Regional oxygenation index (rSO2) based on near-infrared resonance spectroscopy (NIRS) frequently is used to screen for compromised DO2, although its sensitivity to detect severe abnormalities in SvO2 is uncertain. METHODS: ScvO2 was measured by co-oximetry from the internal jugular vein as clinically indicated in 73 neonates after S1P. These values were compared with cerebral rSO2 (FORE-SIGHT; CASMED) via mixed effects model linear regression, Bland-Altman analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Because NIRS devices measure a composite of arterial and venous blood, we calculated an rSO2-based ScvO2 designed to remove arterial contamination from the rSO2 signal: rSO2-based ScvO2~=~(rSO2 - arterial oxygen saturation~{\texttimes}~0.3)/0.7. RESULTS: Among 520 time-matched pairs of ScvO2 and cerebral rSO2, the slope of the relationship between rSO2 and ScvO2 (after we adjusted for effects of hemoglobin) was 0.37~{\textpm}~0.04 with only modest correlation (r2~=~0.39), and mean bias of +8.26. When ScvO2 was {$<$}30\%, cerebral rSO2 was {$<$}30 in less than 1\%, {$<$}40 less than 1\%, and {$<$}50 in 45.7\% of data points; specificity of rSO2 in the same range is {$>$}99\%. Correction of rSO2 for arterial contamination significantly decreased mean bias (+3.03) and improved the sensitivity of rSO2 to detect ScvO2~{$<$}30 to 6.5\% for rSO2~{$<$}30, 29\% for rSO2~{$<$}40, and 77.4\% for rSO2~{$<$}50. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral rSO2 in isolation should not be used to detect low ScvO2, because its sensitivity is low, although correction of rSO2 for arterial contamination may improve sensitivity. Cerebral rSO2 of 50 or greater should not be considered reassuring, though values below 30 are specific for low ScvO2.},

Methods To find such a suitable reference tissue for QSM of the brain, melanoma patients with and without brain metastases were measured. Twelve reference regions were chosen and assessed for stability of susceptibility values with respect to multiple intra-individual and inter-individual measurements, age, and stage of disease. Results Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the internal capsule and one region in the splenium of the corpus callosum are the regions with the smallest standard deviations of the mean susceptibility value. The mean susceptibility is 0.010 {\textpm} 0.014 ppm for CSF in the atrium of the lateral ventricles (csfpost), -0.060 {\textpm} 0.019 ppm for the posterior limb of the internal capsule (ci2), and -0.008 {\textpm} 0.019 ppm for the splenium of the corpus callosum. csfpost and ci2 show nearly no dependence on age or stage of disease, whereas some other regions, e.g., the red nucleus, show moderate dependence on age or disease. Conclusion The internal capsule and CSF appear to be the most suitable reference regions for QSM of the brain in the melanoma patients studied. Both showed virtually no dependence on age or disease and small variations among patients.

The goal of the present study was to examine the morphology of the corpus callosum in healthy participants of both sexes, from infancy to early adulthood. We sought to characterize normal development of the corpus callosum and possible sex differences in development. We performed a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 114 healthy individuals, aged 1 month to 25 years old, measuring the size of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was segmented into seven subareas of the rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium. Locally weighted regression analysis (LOESS) indicated significant non-linear age-related changes regardless of sex, particularly during the first few years of life. After this increase, curve slopes gradually became flat during adolescence and adulthood in both sexes. Age of local maximum for each subarea of the corpus callosum differed across the sexes. Ratios of total corpus callosum and genu, posterior midbody, as well as splenium to the whole brain were significantly higher in females compared with males. The present results demonstrate that the developmental trajectory of the corpus callosum during early life in healthy individuals is non-linear and dynamic. This pattern resembles that found for the cerebral cortex, further suggesting that this period plays a very important role in neural and functional development. In addition, developmental trajectories and changes in growth do show some sex differences.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but measures that track cognitive change in PD are lacking. Brain tissue iron accumulates with age and co-localises with pathological proteins linked to PD dementia such as amyloid. We used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to detect changes related to cognitive change in PD. Methods We assessed 100 patients with early-stage to mid-stage PD, and 37 age-matched controls using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a validated clinical algorithm for risk of cognitive decline in PD, measures of visuoperceptual function and the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 (UPDRS-III). We investigated the association between these measures and QSM, an MRI technique sensitive to brain tissue iron content. Results We found QSM increases (consistent with higher brain tissue iron content) in PD compared with controls in prefrontal cortex and putamen (p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Whole brain regression analyses within the PD group identified QSM increases covarying: (1) with lower MoCA scores in the hippocampus and thalamus, (2) with poorer visual function and with higher dementia risk scores in parietal, frontal and medial occipital cortices, (3) with higher UPDRS-III scores in the putamen (all p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, atrophy, measured using voxel-based morphometry, showed no differences between groups, or in association with clinical measures. Conclusions Brain tissue iron, measured using QSM, can track cognitive involvement in PD. This may be useful to detect signs of early cognitive change to stratify groups for clinical trials and monitor disease progression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide further quantitative studies concerning the relationship with age between regional brain iron and T2 shortening. METHODS: a) Quantitative T2 calculations of eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, temporal lobe white matter, and frontal lobe white matter) from T2-weighted spin-echo images were performed in 60 patients aged newborn to 35 years. b) Quantitative brain iron concentrations were obtained in six of the eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, cauda, and putamen) using 13 autopsied brains (newborn to 78 years). Brain tissue from these six regions was digested with 0.6 N HCl-2.5\% wt/vol KMnO4 for 2 hours at 60 degrees C. After centrifugation, 0.1 mL of an iron-chelating reagent (2 mol/L ascorbic acid, 5 mol/L ammonium acetate, 6.5 nmol/L ferrozine, 13.1 mmol/L neocuprine) was added and the absorbance was measured at 562 nm/L and compared with a standard curve with ferric chloride. c) The in vivo iron concentrations in tissue that were obtained were reproduced in four test tube phantom studies with ferric ammonium sulfate or ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolved in either deionized water or 5\% agarose. T2 calculations of the phantoms were made with a single-section multiple repetition time, multiple echo time acquisition. RESULTS: a) Clinical T2 calculations--all eight anatomic regions showed a decrease with age in T2 value, beginning shortly after birth. During the first three decades, the T2 shortening was most significant in the region of substantia nigra. b) Quantitative brain iron--five anatomic regions but not the corpus callosum demonstrated an age-related increase in brain iron (1449.6 nmol/g for the red nucleus versus 261.8 nmol/g for the corpus callosum). c) T2 effect of iron in vitro--both the ferric and ferrous iron phantoms showed a decreased T2 value in the in vivo concentration range of iron obtained from the postmortem studies. The T2 shortening was most marked for the ferric phantoms. CONCLUSION: There is an age-related accumulation of iron in five regions of the brain, correlating with an associated decrease in T2 value that can be demonstrated in iron phantoms.

Thus, the clinical applications of QSM are wide-reaching and hold great promise as imaging biomarkers for studying several neurological diseases.

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tissue magnetic susceptibility to advance from simple qualitative detection of hypointense blooming artifacts to precise quantitative measurement of spatial biodistributions. QSM technology may be regarded to be sufficiently developed and validated to warrant wide dissemination for clinical applications of imaging isotropic susceptibility, which is dominated by metals in tissue, including iron and calcium. These biometals are highly regulated as vital participants in normal cellular biochemistry, and their dysregulations are manifested in a variety of pathologic processes. Therefore, QSM can be used to assess important tissue functions and disease. To facilitate QSM clinical translation, this review aims to organize pertinent information for implementing a robust automated QSM technique in routine MRI practice and to summarize available knowledge on diseases for which QSM can be used to improve patient care. In brief, QSM can be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification; and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance requires contrast agent injection. Clinicians may consider integrating QSM into their routine imaging practices by including gradient echo sequences in all relevant MRI protocols. Level of Evidence: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J.

  abstract = {In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2* contrast, which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to provide references, codes, and testing data for readers interested in QSM.

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel MRI technique for measuring tissue magnetic susceptibility in 3D. While there are numerous algorithms developed to solve this ill-posed inverse problem, estimating susceptibility maps with a wide range of values is still problematic. In cases such as large veins, contrast agent uptake, and intracranial hemorrhages, extreme susceptibility values in focal areas cause severe streaking artifacts. To enable the reduction of these artifacts while preserving subtle susceptibility contrast, a two-level QSM reconstruction algorithm (STAR-QSM) was developed in this study by tuning a regularization parameter to automatically reconstruct both large and small susceptibility values. Compared to current state-of-the-art QSM methods such as iLSQR, STAR-QSM significantly reduced streaking artifacts while preserving sharp boundaries for blood vessels of mouse brains in vivo and fine anatomical details of high resolution mouse brains ex vivo. Brain image data from patients with cerebral hematoma and multiple sclerosis further illustrated the superiority of this method in reducing streaking artifacts caused by large susceptibility sources while maintaining sharp anatomical details. STAR-QSM is implemented in STI Suite, a comprehensive shareware for susceptibility imaging and quantification.},

MRI was performed and S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} was calculated using SWI-MRI data obtained in the straight section of the superior sagittal sinus. Blood perfusion was estimated using PDU and FMBV from the frontal lobe in a mid-sagittal plane of the fetal brain.

In normal growth fetuses, S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} showed a mild decreasing trend (slope = --0.7 {\textpm} 0.4; \emph{p} = 0.1), whereas FMBV showed a mild increasing trend (slope = 0.2 {\textpm} 0.2; \emph{p} = 0.2) with advancing gestation, and a mild but significant negative association (slope = --0.78 {\textpm} 0.3; \emph{r} = --0.4; \emph{p} = 0.04) between these two estimates. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Combined MRI (SWI) and ultrasound (FMBV) techniques showed a significant association between cerebral blood oxygenation and blood perfusion in normal growth and growth-restricted fetuses.

Methods Thirty-six pregnant women, having a mean gestational age (GA) of 31 2/7 weeks, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) data from the fetal brain was acquired. {$\Delta\chi$}v, of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was quantified using MR susceptometry from the intra-vascular phase measurements. Assuming the magnetic property of fetal blood, {$\Delta\chi$}do, is the same as that of adult blood, SvO2 was derived from the measured {$\Delta\chi$}v. The variation of {$\Delta\chi$}v and SvO2, as a function of GA, was statistically evaluated. Results The mean {$\Delta\chi$}v in the SSS in the second-trimester (n=8) and third-trimester fetuses (n=28) was found to be 0.34{\textpm}0.06ppm and 0.49{\textpm}0.05ppm, respectively. Correspondingly, the derived SvO2 values were 69.4\%{\textpm}3.27\% and 62.6\%{\textpm}3.25\%. Although not statistically significant, an increasing trend (p=0.08) in {$\Delta\chi$}v and a decreasing trend (p=0.22) in SvO2, with respect to advancing gestation was observed. Conclusion We report cerebral venous blood magnetic susceptibility and putative oxygen saturation in healthy human fetuses. Cerebral oxygen saturation in healthy human fetuses, despite a slight decreasing trend, does not change significantly with advancing gestation.},

METHODS: Twenty-six AD patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were prospectively recruited in this study. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive status. We applied the QQ-CCTV algorithm which combines quantitative susceptibility mapping and quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent models (QQ) for OEF calculation. CBF map was computed from arterial spin labeling and CMRO2 was generated based on Fick's principle. Whole-brain and regional OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 analyses were performed. The associations between these measures in substructures of deep brain gray matter and MMSE scores were assessed. RESULTS: Whole brain voxel-wise analysis showed that CBF and CMRO2 values significantly decreased in AD predominantly in the bilateral angular gyrus, precuneus gyrus and parieto-temporal regions. Regional analysis showed that CBF value decreased in the bilateral caudal hippocampus and left rostral hippocampus and CMRO2 value decreased in left caudal and rostral hippocampus in AD patients. Considering all subjects in the AD and HC groups combined, the mean CBF and CMRO2 values in the bilateral hippocampus positively correlated with the MMSE score. CONCLUSION: CMRO2 mapping with the QQ-CCTV method - which is readily available in MR systems for clinical practice - can be a potential biomarker for AD. In addition, CMRO2 in the hippocampus may be a useful tool for monitoring cognitive impairment.},

Although cerebral maturation is associated with an increase in cerebral glucose consumption, the relationship between CVo2 and increasing gestational age has not previously been assessed in humans. The aims of this study were to evaluate a noninvasive method for the estimation of CVo2 in the neonate using near infrared spectroscopy, and to investigate the relationship between gestational age and CVo2. Twenty babies who were undergoing intensive care in the neonatal period were studied. Cerebral hemoglobin flow (CHbF) and cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (CSvo2) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was measure by pulse oximetry (Spo2). CVo2 was calculated from the equation: CVo2 = CHbF {\texttimes}(Spo2 - Svo2 {\texttimes} 4. The median (range) CVo2 was 0.9(0.52-1.76) mL{$\cdot$}100 g-1 min-1. There was an increase in CVo2 with advancing gestational age (n = 20, {$\rho$} = 0.55,p = 0.014). We conclude that CVo2 can be estimated in sick neonates using noninvasive optical methods. The values obtained are similar to those obtained in other studies by more invasive methods, and are in agreement with values which would be expected from the known rate of cerebral glucose consumption in neonates. Mean (SD) CVo2 at 24-26 wk was 0.5 (0.18) mL{$\cdot$}100 g-1 min-1 and rose with increasing gestation to term by 0.03 mL{$\cdot$}100 g-1 min-1 per wk.},

To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

  abstract = {Iron is an essential cofactor for many proteins that are involved in normal neuronal tissue function, but there is increasing evidence that iron accumulation in the brain can cause a vast array of CNS disorders.Global iron homeostasis is regulated at the level of iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. This involves a series of molecular interactions between proteins that include the haemochromatosis gene product HFE, transferrin, the transferrin receptor and iron regulatory proteins in the crypts of Lieberk{\"u}hn.The brain has several characteristics that make it unique with regard to iron metabolism. It resides behind a vascular barrier --- the blood--brain barrier --- which limits its access to plasma iron. Also, the concentration of iron varies considerably between different brain regions: regions that are associated with motor functions tend to have more iron than non-motor-related regions.Iron seems to accumulate in the brain as a function of age. This process is quite specific, and it involves the accumulation of iron-containing molecules in certain cell types, particularly in brain regions that are preferentially targeted in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).PD is associated with increased iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. Proposed mechanisms for iron-induced cell damage in PD include enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and an increase in oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This includes the aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, which is one of the main components of Lewy bodies --- one of the pathological hallmarks of PD.In AD, iron accumulation in the brain occurs without the normal age-related increase in ferritin, and this increases the risk of oxidative stress. Iron might also have a direct impact on plaque formation through its effects on amyloid precursor protein processing.Iron accumulation has also been implicated in several other neurological diseases, including congenital aceruloplasminaemia, Friedreich's ataxia, neuroferritinopathy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and restless legs syndrome.Metal chelators are being developed as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD, AD and other neurodegenerative disorders that involve iron misregulation.If we can understand the timing of iron mismanagement in relation to the progression of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases and during ageing, this might raise the possibility of monitoring iron changes as a marker of disease progression, and perhaps even pre-clinical diagnosis in conditions where iron mismanagement is an early event.},

Existing atlases are mainly based on anatomical features derived from T1-and T2-weighted MRI. A 4D developmental quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) atlas may facilitate the estimation of age-related iron changes in deep gray matter nuclei and myelin changes in white matter. To this end, group-wise co-registered QSM templates were generated over various age intervals from age 1--83 years old. Registration was achieved by combining both T1-weighted and QSM images. Based on the proposed template, we created an accurate deep gray matter nuclei parcellation map (DGM map). Notably, we segmented thalamus into 5 sub-regions, i.e. the anterior nuclei, the median nuclei, the lateral nuclei, the pulvinar and the internal medullary lamina. Furthermore, we built a ``whole brain QSM parcellation map'' by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter atlases with the proposed DGM map. Based on the proposed QSM atlas, the segmentation accuracy of iron-rich nuclei using QSM is significantly improved, especially for children and adolescent subjects. The age-related progression of magnetic susceptibility in each of the deep gray matter nuclei, the hippocampus, and the amygdala was estimated. Our automated atlas-based analysis provided a systematic confirmation of previous findings on susceptibility progression with age resulting from manual ROI drawings in deep gray matter nuclei. The susceptibility development in the hippocampus and the amygdala follow an iron accumulation model; while in the thalamus sub-regions, the susceptibility development exhibits a variety of trends. It is envisioned that the newly developed 4D QSM atlas will serve as a template for studying brain iron deposition and myelination/demyelination in both normal aging and various brain diseases.}

  abstract = {The human brain rapidly develops during the first two years following birth. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides information of iron and myelin variations. It is considered to be a valuable tool for studying brain development in early life. In the present work, QSM is performed on neonates, 1-year and 2-year old infants, as well as a group of adults for the purpose of reference. Age-specific templates representing common brain structures are built for each age group. The neonate and infant QSM templates have shown some unique findings compared to conventional T1w and T2w imaging techniques. The contrast between the gray and white matters on the QSM images did not change through brain development from neonate to adult. A linear correlation was found between brain myelination determined in this study and the microscopic myelin degree determined by a previous autopsy study. Also, the magnetic susceptibility values of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) exhibit a gradually decreasing trend from birth to 2 years old and to adulthood. The findings suggest that the macromolecular content, myelin, and iron may play the most important contributing factors for the magnetic susceptibility of neonate and infant brain. QSM can be a powerful means to study early brain development and related pathologies that involve alterations in macromolecular content, iron, or brain myelination.}

  abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Globally, 15 million infants are born prematurely, putting these children at an increased risk of mortality and lifelong health challenges. Currently in the U.S., there is only one FDA approved therapy for the prevention of preterm birth. Makena is an intramuscular progestin injection given to women who have experienced a premature delivery in the past. Recently, however, Makena failed a confirmatory trial, resulting the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER) recommendation for the FDA to withdrawal Makena's approval. This recommendation would leave clinicians with no therapeutic options for preventing PTB. Here, we outline recent interdisciplinary efforts involving physicians, pharmacologists, biologists, chemists, and engineers to understand risk factors associated with PTB, mechanisms that contribute to PTB, and to develop next generation therapies for preventing PTB. These advances have the potential to better identify women at risk for PTB, prevent the onset of premature labor, and, ultimately, save infant lives.,},
