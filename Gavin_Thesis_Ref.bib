  abstract = {A sensitive and accurate imaging technique capable of tracking the disease progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) driven amnestic dementia would be beneficial. A currently available method for pathology detection in AD with high accuracy is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, despite certain limitations such as low spatial resolution, off-targeting error, and radiation exposure. Non-invasive MRI scanning with quantitative magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used as a complementary tool. To date, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has widely been used in tracking deep gray matter iron accumulation in AD. The present work proposes that by compartmentalizing quantitative susceptibility into paramagnetic and diamagnetic components, more holistic information about AD pathogenesis can be acquired. Particularly, diamagnetic component susceptibility (DCS) can be a powerful indicator for tracking protein accumulation in the gray matter (GM), demyelination in the white matter (WM), and relevant changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the current work, voxel-wise group analysis of the WM and the CSF regions show significantly lower {\textbar}DCS{\textbar} (the absolute value of DCS) value for amnestic dementia patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, {\textbar}DCS{\textbar} and {$\tau$} PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) were found to be associated in several GM regions typically affected by {$\tau$} deposition in AD. Therefore, we propose that the separated diamagnetic susceptibility can be used to track pathological neurodegeneration in different tissue types and regions of the brain. With the initial evidence, we believe the usage of compartmentalized susceptibility demonstrates substantive potential as an MRI-based technique for tracking AD-driven neurodegeneration.},

Although experimental data suggest that the newborn brain may be more resistant to ischemic injury than the adult brain, the minimum CBF necessary to sustain neuronal viability in newborn infants is unknown. We have measured CBF with positron emission tomography in 16 preterm and 14 term newborn infants and have determined the relationship between CBF and subsequent brain function as assessed by neurological examination and developmental assessment. The range of mean CBF in the preterm infants was 4.9 to 23 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) and the range of mean CBF in the term infants was 9.0 to 73 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min). Five preterm infants and one term infant with mean CBF less than 10 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) survived. Three of these 5 preterm infants, with mean CBF of 4.9, 5.2, and 9.3 ml/ (100 gm {$\cdot$} min, respectively, have normal neurological examinations and Bayley Scales of 80 or greater at 6, 6, and 24 months of age, respectively. One (mean CBF 6.9) has normal cognitive development (Bayley 103) and a mild spastic diplegia at age 19 months, and one infant (mean CBF 6.2) has a left hemiparesis and a Binet IQ score of 70 at age 33 months. The term infant, with a mean CBF of 9.0 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min), was developing normally when he died of Septembersis at age 5 months. These data indicate that mean CBF as low as 5 ml/(100 gm {$\cdot$} min) in newborn infants can be associated with normal subsequent neurological development and therefore with preservation of a substantial number of cortical/ neurons. Since the minimal CBF below this value necessary to maintain neuronal viability in newborn infants remains to be determined, measurements of CBF in the newborn period should not be used in determination of brain death.},

  abstract = {Background Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) may serve as biomarkers in several diseases. OEF and CMRO2 can be estimated from venous blood oxygenation (Yv) levels, which in turn can be calculated from venous blood T2 values (T2b). T2b can be measured using different MRI sequences, including T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and T2-prepared-blood-relaxation-imaging-with-inversion-recovery (T2-TRIR). The latter measures both T2b and T1 (T1b) but was found previously to overestimate T2b compared to TRUST. It remained unclear, however, if this bias is constant across higher and lower oxygen saturations. Purpose To compare TRUST and T2-TRIR across a range of O2 saturations using hypoxic and hypercapnic gas challenges. Study Type Prospective. Population Twelve healthy volunteers (four female, age 36 {\textpm} 10 years). Field Strength/Sequence A 3T; turbo-field echo-planar-imaging (TFEPI), echo-planar-imaging (EPI), and fast-field-echo (FFE). Assessment TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 were compared across different respiratory challenges. T1b from T2-TRIR was used to estimate Hct (HctTRIR) and compared with venipuncture (HctVP). Statistical Tests Shapiro--Wilk, one-sample and paired-sample t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman test, Bland--Altman, and correlation analysis. Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction was performed. Significance level was 0.05. Results A significant bias was observed between TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived T2b, Yv, and OEF values (-13 {\textpm} 11 msec, -5.3\% {\textpm} 3.5\% and 5.9 {\textpm} 4.1\%, respectively). For Yv and OEF, this bias was constant across the range of measured values. T1b was significantly lower during severe hypoxia and hypercapnia compared to baseline (1712 {\textpm} 86 msec and 1634 {\textpm} 79 msec compared to 1757 {\textpm} 90 msec). While no significant bias was found between HctVP and HctTRIR (0.02\% {\textpm} 0.06\%, P = 0.20), the correlation between these Hct values was significant but weak (r = 0.19). Data Conclusion Given the constant bias, TRUST- and T2-TRIR-derived venous T2b values can be used interchangeably to estimate Yv, OEF, and CMRO2 across a broad range of oxygen saturations. Hct from T2-TRIR-derived T1-values only weakly correlated with Hct from venipuncture. Evidence Level 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 2.},

This review aims to present NIR spectroscopy as a matured technique, yet with great potential for further advances in several directions throughout broadly understood bio-applications.

Complications and the disturbance of normal development may result from factors that influence prenatal development and the etiology of preterm birth, but the extent to which this happens is often unknown. Although this chapter is by no means a complete catalog of complications of preterm birth, this chapter discusses how these various complications reflect immaturity; the impact that they have on survival, organ maturation, and health; and the efficacies of a number of intervention strategies designed to prevent and mitigate the effects of these complications. As outlined in Chapter 2, information based on gestational age is preferred over information based on birth weight because of the value of knowledge of gestation age in making decisions regarding preterm delivery and prenatal counseling of the parent.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a promising non-invasive method for obtaining information relating to the oxygen metabolism. However, the optimal acquisition sequence and QSM reconstruction method for reliable venous susceptibility measurements are unknown. Full flow compensation is generally recommended to correct for the influence of venous blood flow, although the effect of flow compensation on the accuracy of venous susceptibility values has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effect of different acquisition sequences, including different flow compensation schemes, and different QSM reconstruction methods on venous susceptibilities. Ten healthy subjects were scanned with five or six distinct QSM sequence designs implementing different flow compensation schemes. All data sets were processed using six different QSM pipelines and venous blood susceptibility was evaluated in whole-brain segmentations of the venous vasculature and single veins. The quality of vein segmentations and the accuracy of venous susceptibility values were analyzed and compared between all combinations of sequences and QSM methods. The influence of the QSM method on average venous susceptibility values was found to be 2.7 - 11.6 times greater than the influence of the acquisition sequence, including flow compensation. The majority of the investigated QSM reconstruction methods tended to underestimate venous susceptibility values in the vein segmentations that were obtained. Using multi-echo gradient-echo acquisitions with monopolar readout gradients, we found that sequences without full flow compensation yielded venous susceptibility values comparable to sequences with full flow compensation. However, the QSM method had a great influence on susceptibility values and thus needs to be considered carefully for accurate venous QSM.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of MRI methods exploiting magnetic susceptibility properties of blood to assess cerebral oxygen metabolism, including the tissue oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The first section is devoted to describing blood magnetic susceptibility and its effect on the MRI signal. Blood circulating in the vasculature can have diamagnetic (oxyhemoglobin) or paramagnetic properties (deoxyhemoglobin). The overall balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin determines the induced magnetic field which, in turn, modulates the transverse relaxation decay of the MRI signal via additional phase accumulation. The following sections of this review then illustrate the principles underpinning susceptibility-based techniques for quantifying OEF and CMRO2. Here, it is detailed whether these techniques provide global (OxFlow) or local (Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping - QSM, calibrated BOLD - cBOLD, quantitative BOLD - qBOLD, QSM+qBOLD) measurements of OEF or CMRO2, and what signal components (magnitude or phase) and tissue pools they consider (intravascular or extravascular). Validations studies and potential limitations of each method are also described. The latter include (but are not limited to) challenges in the experimental setup, the accuracy of signal modeling, and assumptions on the measured signal. The last section outlines the clinical uses of these techniques in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases and contextualizes these reports relative to results from gold-standard PET.},

In this paper, we review the advances currently being made and issues to consider for improving optical image quality. These include the optimal selection of wavelengths to minimize random and systematic error propagation in the calculation of the hemoglobin concentrations, the filtering of systemic physiological signal clutter to improve sensitivity to the hemodynamic response to brain activation, the implementation of overlapping measurements to improve image spatial resolution and uniformity, and the utilization of spatial prior information from structural and functional MRI to reduce DOI partial volume error and improve image quantitative accuracy.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a means to obtain direct measurements of local tissue susceptibility distribution. Usually the focus is on imaging tissues in the brain, and the region of the brain studied is dictated by an eroded skull stripped mask. Producing the pristine local phase behavior for regions at the edge of the brain has been difficult in the past. For structures such as the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) that run alongside the surface of the brain and under the skull bones, a considerable part of the external phase from the dipole effect is lost due to the short T2* of the bones. In this paper, we propose a method that seeks to reconstruct the susceptibility distribution inside the dural sinuses by ensuring that the entire geometry of the dural sinuses is preserved with the help of an MR angiogram and venogram (MRAV). Having a geometrical model of the vessels makes it possible to estimate the missing phase outside the brain as well, by using the forward phase model and, hence, allowing a complete phase map to be reconstructed. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned using a susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequence with interleaved rephaseddephased echoes. QSM results were compared between the conventional techniques and the proposed method of phase preservation outside the brain and inside the dural sinuses. This method demonstrates the reconstruction of the SSS, whereas conventional methods are either unable to preserve this structure or unable to provide complete phase information. The mean and standard deviation inside the SSS for all volunteers was 435 {\textpm} 5 ppb (this is the inter-subject error). To validate the proposed approach, the mean susceptibility inside the straight sinus showed good agreement between conventional approach and the proposed method. The results presented in this study indicate the potential of generating the susceptibility map for the whole brain, including the SSS (as well as potentially all the cortical veins).},

  abstract = {Iron is a key nutrient for normal central nervous system (CNS) development and function; thus, iron deficiency as well as iron excess may result in harmful effects in the CNS. Oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are crucial players in brain iron equilibrium. However, the mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes during CNS development or under pathological situations such as demyelination are not completely understood. In the CNS, iron is directly required for myelin production as a cofactor for enzymes involved in ATP, cholesterol and lipid synthesis, and oligodendrocytes are the cells with the highest iron levels in the brain which is linked to their elevated metabolic needs associated with the process of myelination. Unlike oligodendrocytes, astrocytes do not have a high metabolic requirement for iron. However, these cells are in close contact with blood vessel and have a strong iron transport capacity. In several pathological situations, changes in iron homoeostasis result in altered cellular iron distribution and accumulation and oxidative stress. In inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, reactive astrocytes accumulate iron and upregulate iron efflux and influx molecules, which suggest that they are outfitted to take up and safely recycle iron. In this review, we will discuss the participation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in CNS iron homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake, storage, and efflux in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is necessary for planning effective strategies for iron management during CNS development as well as for the treatment of demyelinating diseases.},

In the whole brain, compared to HC, MS had lower OEF, 30.4\,{\textpm}\,3.3\% vs. 21.4\,{\textpm}\,4.4\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and higher  {$\chi$}n , -23.7\,{\textpm}\,7.0\,ppb vs. -11.3\,{\textpm}\,7.7\,ppb (p\,=\,0.018). Our feasibility study suggests that OEF may serve as a useful quantitative marker of tissue oxygen utilization in MS.},

  abstract = {Magnetic susceptibility describes the magnetizability of a material to an applied magnetic field and represents an important parameter in the field of MRI. With the recently introduced method of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and its conceptual extension to susceptibility tensor imaging (STI), the non-invasive assessment of this important physical quantity has become possible with MRI. Both methods solve the ill-posed inverse problem to determine the magnetic susceptibility from local magnetic fields. Whilst QSM allows the extraction of the spatial distribution of the bulk magnetic susceptibility from a single measurement, STI enables the quantification of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, but requires multiple measurements with different orientations of the object relative to the main static magnetic field. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the fundamental theoretical foundation of QSM and STI, as well as computational strategies for the characterization of magnetic susceptibility with MRI phase data. In the second part, we provide an overview of current methodological and clinical applications of QSM with a focus on brain imaging. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Increased iron in subcortical gray matter (GM) structures of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) has been suggested as a causal factor in neuronal degeneration. But how iron content is related to white matter (WM) changes in HD is still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether WM changes share the same physiopathology (i.e. iron accumulation) with GM or whether there is a different mechanism. The present study used MRI to examine iron content in premanifest gene carriers (PreHD, n = 25) and in early HD patients (n = 25) compared with healthy controls (n = 50). 3T MRI acquisitions included high resolution 3D T1, EPI sequences for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an indirect measure of tissue integrity, and T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging for MR-based relaxometry (R2*), which provides an indirect measure of ferritin/iron deposition in the brain. Myelin breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, but there is no difference in iron content values. Iron content reduction manifests later, in the early HD stage, in which we found a lower R2* parameter value in the isthmus. The WM iron reduction in HD is temporally well-defined (no iron differences in PreHD subjects and iron differences only in early HD patients). Iron level in callosal WM may be regarded as a marker of disease state, as iron does not differentiate PreHD subjects from controls but distinguishes between PreHD and HD.

Despite this optimistic trend, preterm birth rates remain higher in the USA, where nearly one in every eight infants is born early, compared to other developed countries. The prevention of preterm birth is considered a public health priority because of the potential to reduce infant and childhood morbidity and mortality related to this condition. Unfortunately, progress has been modest. One of the greatest challenges in studying this outcome is that preterm birth is a complex condition resulting from multiple etiologic pathways. Recently, experts have developed innovative frameworks for classifying and studying preterm birth based on phenotype. These proposed classification systems have only recently been adopted, but a different perspective on a longstanding problem has the potential to lead to new discoveries.},

  abstract = {Beta amyloid is a protein fragment snipped from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Aggregation of these peptides into amyloid plaques is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. MR imaging of beta amyloid plaques has been attempted using various techniques, notably with T2* contrast. The non-invasive detectability of beta amyloid plaques in MR images has so far been largely attributed to focal iron deposition accompanying the plaques. It is believed that the T2* shortening effects of paramagnetic iron are the primary source of contrast between plaques and surrounding tissue. Amyloid plaque itself has been reported to induce no magnetic susceptibility effect. We hypothesized that aggregations of beta amyloid would increase electron density and induce notable changes in local susceptibility value, large enough to generate contrast relative to surrounding normal tissues that can be visualized by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MR imaging. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated in a phantom that beta amyloid is diamagnetic and can generate strong contrast on susceptibility maps. We then conducted experiments on a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that is known to mimic the formation of human beta amyloid but without neurofibrillary tangles or neuronal death. Over a period of 18 months, we showed that QSM can be used to longitudinally monitor beta amyloid accumulation and accompanied iron deposition in vivo. Individual beta amyloid plaque can also be visualized ex vivo in high resolution susceptibility maps. Moreover, the measured negative susceptibility map and positive susceptibility map could provide histology-like image contrast for identifying deposition of beta amyloid plaques and iron. Finally, we demonstrated that the diamagnetic susceptibility of beta amyloid can also be observed in brain specimens of AD patients. The ability to assess beta amyloid aggregation non-invasively with QSM MR imaging may aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Objective Cerebral venous oxygenation (Yv) is a key parameter for the brain's oxygen utilization and has been suggested to be a valuable biomarker in various brain diseases including hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in neonates and Alzheimer's disease in older adults. T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI is a widely used technique to measure global Yv level and has been validated against gold-standard PET. However, subject motion during TRUST MRI scan can introduce considerable errors in Yv quantification, especially for noncompliant subjects. The aim of this study was to develop an Automatic Rejection based on Tissue Signal (ARTS) algorithm for automatic detection and exclusion of motion-contaminated images to improve the precision of Yv quantification. Methods TRUST MRI data were collected from a neonatal cohort (N~=~37, 16 females, gestational age~=~39.12~{\textpm}~1.11~weeks, postnatal age~=~1.89~{\textpm}~0.74~days) and an older adult cohort (N~=~223, 134 females, age~=~68.02~{\textpm}~9.01~years). Manual identification of motion-corrupted images was conducted for both cohorts to serve as a gold-standard. 9.3\% of the images in the neonatal datasets and 0.4\% of the images in the older adult datasets were manually identified as motion-contaminated. The ARTS algorithm was trained using the neonatal datasets. TRUST Yv values, as well as the estimation uncertainty ({$\Delta$}R2) and test-retest coefficient-of-variation (CoV) of Yv, were calculated with and without ARTS motion exclusion. The ARTS algorithm was tested on datasets of older adults: first on the original adult datasets with little motion, and then on simulated adult datasets where the percentage of motion-corrupted images matched that of the neonatal datasets. Results In the neonatal datasets, the ARTS algorithm exhibited a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.97 in detecting motion-contaminated images. Compared to no motion exclusion, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 (median~=~3.68~Hz vs. 4.89~Hz, P~=~0.0002) and CoV (median~=~2.57\% vs. 6.87\%, P~=~0.0005) of Yv measurements. In the original older adult datasets, the sensitivity and specificity of ARTS were 0.70 and 1.00, respectively. In the simulated adult datasets, ARTS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 1.00. Additionally, ARTS significantly reduced the {$\Delta$}R2 compared to no motion exclusion (median~=~2.15~Hz vs. 3.54~Hz, P~{$<~$}0.0001). Conclusion ARTS can improve the reliability of Yv estimation in noncompliant subjects, which may enhance the utility of Yv as a biomarker for brain diseases.},

Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (S(v)O(2)) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO(2) in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO(2)) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO(2) (CMRO(2)(i)) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO(2) were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O(2)/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO(2) values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global S(v)O(2), CBF, and CMRO(2) with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R(2)=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

While significant increases in SvO2 and tCBF were observed during hypercapnia (P {$<$} 0.005), no change in CMRO2 was noted (P {$>$} 0.05). Additionally, fractional changes in tCBF and end-tidal carbon dioxide (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), as well as baseline SvO2 and tCBF (R2 = 0.72, P {$<$} 0.005), were found to be correlated.

  abstract = {Purpose: Non-invasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygenation (Yv) in neonates is important in the assessment of brain oxygen extraction and consumption, and may be useful in characterizing brain development and neonatal brain diseases. This study aims to develop a rapid method for vessel-specific measurement of Yv in neonates. Methods: We developed a pulse sequence, named accelerated T2-relaxation-under-phase-contrast (aTRUPC), which consists of velocity-encoding phase-contrast module to isolate pure blood signal, flow-insensitive T2-preparation to quantify blood T2, and turbo-field-echo (TFE) scheme for rapid image acquisition, which is critical for neonatal MRI. A series of studies were conducted. First, the pulse sequence was optimized in terms of TFE factor, velocity encoding (VENC), and slice thickness for best sensitivity. Second, to account for the influence of TFE acquisition on T2 quantification, simulation and experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between TFE-T2 and standard T2. Finally, the complete aTRUPC sequence was applied on a group of healthy neonates and normative Yv values were determined. Results: Optimal parameters of aTRUPC in neonates were found to be a TFE factor of 15, VENC of 5cm/s, and slice thickness of 10mm. TFE-T2 was on average 3.9\% lower than standard T2. These two measures were strongly correlated (R2=0.86), thus their difference can be accounted for by a correction equation, T2,standard=1.2002{\texttimes}T2,TFE-10.6276. Neonatal Yv values in veins draining cortical brain and those draining central brain were 64.8{\textpm}2.9\% and 70.2{\textpm}3.3\%, respectively, with a significant difference (P=0.02). Conclusion: aTRUPC MRI has the potential to provide vessel-specific quantification of cerebral Yv in neonates.},

PET imaging of the brain has been shown to be a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting neurochemical abnormalities associated with various neurologic disorders as well as to study normal brain development. Although its use in detecting neurological abnormalities has been well described in adults and pediatrics, it application in the newborn nursery has not been explored adequately. Early detection of brain injury secondary to intrauterine and perinatal insults using PET imaging can provide new insight in prognosis and in instituting early therapy.

The present study aims to develop a non-invasive, rapid, and reproducible method to measure Yv in a vessel-specific manner. Theory The method, T2-Relaxation-Under-Phase-Contrast (TRU-PC) MRI, utilizes complex subtraction of phase-contrast to isolate pure blood signal, applies non-slice-selective T2-preparation to measure T2, and converts T2 to oxygenation using a calibration plot. Methods Following feasibility demonstration, several technical aspects were examined, including validation with an established global Yv technique, test-retest reproducibility, sensitivity to detect oxygenation changes due to hypoxia and caffeine challenges, applicability of EPI acquisition to shorten scan duration, and ability to study veins with a caliber of 1--2 mm. Results TRU-PC was able to simultaneously measure Yv in all major veins in the brain, including sagittal sinus, straight sinus, great vein, and internal cerebral vein. TRU-PC results showed an excellent agreement with the reference technique, high sensitivity to oxygenation changes, and test-retest variability of 3.5{\textpm}1.0\%. The use of segmented-EPI was able to reduce the scan duration to 1.5 minutes. It was also feasible to study pial veins and deep veins.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

  abstract = {Background  The underlying brain structural changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients have attracted increasing attention. The insulin-resistant state causes iron overload in neurons and leads to lesions in the central nervous system. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can provide a noninvasive quantitative analysis of brain iron deposition. We aimed to compare the difference of brain iron deposition in the gray matter nucleus between T2DM patients and healthy elderly individuals using QSM.  Methods  Thirty-two T2DM patients and thirty-two age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this research. Twenty-three patients and twenty-six HCs underwent cognitive assessments. Brain QSM maps were computed from multiecho GRE data using morphology-enabled dipole inversion with automatic uniform cerebrospinal fluid zero reference algorithm (MEDI+0). ITK-SNAP was used to measure the susceptibility values reflecting the content of iron in the regions of interest (ROIs).  Results  The study included thirty-two T2DM patients (20 males and 12 females; mean age of 61.09 {\textpm} 9.99 years) and 32 HCs (14 males and 18 females; mean age of 59.09 {\textpm} 9.77 years). These participants had no significant difference in age or gender (P {$>$} 0.05). Twenty-three patients with T2DM (11 males and 12 females; mean age, 64.65 {\textpm} 8.44 years) and twenty-six HCs (14 males and 12 females; mean age, 62.30 {\textpm} 6.13 years) received an assessment of cognitive function. T2DM patients exhibited an obviously (t = 3.237, P = 0.003) lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (26.78 {\textpm} 2.35; HCs, 28.42 {\textpm} 0.64; normal standard {$\geq$}26) and a higher Stroop color-word test (SCWT)-C score [87(65,110); HC, 63(60,76.75), Z = -2.232, P = 0.003] than HCs. The mean susceptibility values in the putamen appeared obviously higher in T2DM patients than in HCs (t = -3.994, P {$<$} 0.001). The susceptibility values and cognitive assessment scores showed no obvious association (P {$>$} 0.05). However, an obvious correlation was observed between the changes in the susceptibility values in the putamen and the thalamus/dentate nucleus (r = 0.404, P {$<$} 0.001; r = 0.423, P {$<$} 0.001).  Conclusion  T2DM patients showed increased susceptibility values in the putamen and had declines in executive functions, but the linear association between them was not statistically significant. Changes in susceptibility values in the putamen indicated increased iron deposition and might be used as a quantitative imaging marker of central nervous system injury in T2DM patients. QSM might be able to help probe micro neuronal damage in gray matter and provide information on diabetic encephalopathy.},

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a recently developed MRI technique that provides a quantitative measure of tissue magnetic susceptibility. To compute tissue magnetic susceptibilities based on gradient echoes, QSM requires reliable unwrapping of the measured phase images and removal of contributions caused by background susceptibilities. Typically, the two steps are performed separately. Here, we present a method that simultaneously performs phase unwrapping and HARmonic (background) PhasE REmovaL using the LAplacian operator (HARPERELLA). Both numerical simulations and               in vivo               human brain images show that HARPERELLA effectively removes both phase wraps and background phase, whilst preserving all low spatial frequency components originating from brain tissues. When compared with other QSM phase preprocessing techniques, such as path-based phase unwrapping followed by background phase removal, HARPERELLA preserves the tissue phase signal in gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid with excellent robustness, providing a convenient and accurate solution for QSM. The proposed algorithm is provided, together with QSM and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) tools, in a shared software package named `STI Suite'.

  abstract = {The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is the rate of oxygen consumption by the brain, and is thought to be a direct index of energy homeostasis and brain health. However, in vivo measurement of CMRO2 is challenging, in particular for the neonatal population, in whom conventional radiotracer methods are not applicable because of safety concerns. In this study, we propose a method to quantify global CMRO2 in neonates based on arteriovenous differences in oxygen content, and employ separate measurements of oxygenation and cerebral blood flow (CBF) parameters. Specifically, arterial and venous oxygenation levels were determined with pulse oximetry and the novel T2 relaxation under spin tagging (TRUST) MRI, respectively. Global CBF was measured with phase contrast (PC) flow velocity MRI. The proposed method was implemented on a standard 3-T MRI scanner without the need for any exogenous tracers, and the total scan duration was less than 5\,min. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method in 12 healthy neonates within an age range of 35-42 gestational weeks. CMRO2 values were successfully obtained from 10 neonates. It was found that the average CMRO2 in this age range was 38.3\,{\textpm}\,17.7\,{\textmu}mol/100\,g/min and was positively correlated with age (p\,=\,0.007; slope, 5.2\,{\textmu}mol/100\,g/min per week), although the highest CMRO2 value in this age range was still less than half of the adult level. Test-retest studies showed a coefficient of variation of 5.8\,{\textpm}\,2.2\% between repeated CMRO2 measurements. In addition, given the highly variable blood flow velocity within this age range, it is recommended that the TRUST labeling thickness and position should be determined on a subject-by-subject basis, and an automatic algorithm was developed for this purpose. Although this method provides a global CMRO2 measure only, the clinical significance of an energy consumption marker and the convenience of this technique may make it a useful tool in the functional assessment of the neonatal population.},

It first uses the frequency shift in the MRI signal to map the magnetic field profile within the tissue. The resulting field map is then used to determine the spatial distribution of the underlying magnetic susceptibility by solving an inverse problem. The solution is achieved by deconvolving the field map with a dipole field, under the assumption that the magnetic field results from a superposition of the dipole fields generated by all voxels and that each voxel has its own unique magnetic susceptibility. QSM provides an improved contrast-to-noise ratio for certain tissues and structures compared with its magnitude counterpart. More importantly, magnetic susceptibility directly reflects the molecular composition and cellular architecture of the tissue. Consequently, by quantifying magnetic susceptibility, QSM is becoming a quantitative imaging approach for characterizing normal and pathological tissue properties.

It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose Cerebral tissue oxygenation is a critical brain viability parameter, and the magnetic properties of hemoglobin offer the opportunity to noninvasively quantify oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrahigh-field MRI shows advantages such as increased sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility differences and improved signal-to-noise ratio that can be translated into smaller voxel size, but also increased sensitivity to static and B1 field inhomogeneities. The aim was to produce a systematic comparison of three MRI-based methods for estimation of OEF. Methods OEF estimates in 16 healthy subjects were obtained at 7T utilizing susceptometry-based oximetry (SBO), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). Two major draining veins, that is, the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the straight sinus (SS), were investigated, including mutual agreement between the methods in each of the two different vessels, agreement between vessels as well as potential vessel angle and vessel size dependences. Results Very good correlation (r~=~.88) was found between SBO-based and QSM-based OEF estimates in SSS. Only QSM showed a moderate correlation (r~=~.61) between corresponding OEF estimates in SSS and SS. For SBO, a trend of increasing OEF estimates was observed as the SS vessel angle relative to the main magnetic field increased. No obvious size dependence could be established for any method. The R2*-based OEF estimates were reasonable (35\%-36\%), but the observed range was somewhat low. Conclusion The results indicate that QSM is a promising candidate for assessment of OEF estimates, for example, providing reasonably robust estimates across a wide range of vessel orientations.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of cerebral venous oxygenation can serve as a tool for better understanding fMRI signals and for clinical evaluation of brain oxygen homeostasis. In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 {\textpm} 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 {\textpm} 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 {\textpm} 1.1\%.

  abstract = {Aim To characterize corpus callosum development in neonates born very preterm from early in life to term-equivalent age and its relationship with neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age. Method In a prospective cohort of 193 neonates born preterm, 24 to 32 weeks' gestation, we used magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging acquired early in life (n=193) and at term-equivalent age (n=159) to measure corpus callosum development: mid-sagittal area (including corpus callosum subdivisions) and length, and fractional anisotropy from the genu and splenium. We examined the association of (1) intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and white matter injury (WMI) severity, and (2) neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age with corpus callosum development. Results Severe WMI and severe IVH were strongly associated with reduced corpus callosum area (both p{$<$}0.001) and WMI with lower fractional anisotropy (p=0.002). Mild WMI predicted smaller corpus callosum area only posteriorly; mild IVH predicted smaller area throughout. Adverse motor outcome was associated with smaller corpus callosum size in the posterior subdivision (p=0.003). Abnormal cognitive outcomes were associated with lower corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (p=0.008). Interpretation In newborn infants born very preterm, brain injury is associated with changes in simple metrics of corpus callosum development. In this population, the development of the corpus callosum, as reflected by size and microstructure, is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months corrected age.},

Near-infrared spectroscopy can augment current physiologic monitoring to increase awareness of abnormal perfusion status in the preterm population and potentially reduce risks associated with many diseases that may lead to ischemic injury. This article provides an overview describing NIRS technology and function, its current use in neonatology, and pertinent research findings illustrating its benefit in the neonatal population.

Iron plays an important role in many neurodevelopmental processes, and animal studies suggest that iron sufficiency in pregnancy and infancy is particularly important for neurodevelopment. However, it is not clear whether iron deficiency directly impacts developmental outcomes, and, if so, whether impact differs by timing of exposure or developmental domain. We searched four databases for studies on iron deficiency or iron supplementation in pregnancy, or at 0--6 months, 6--24 months, or 2--4 years of age. All studies included neurodevelopmental assessments in infants or children up to 4 years old. We then qualitatively synthesized the literature. There was no clear relationship between iron status and developmental outcomes across any of the time windows or domains included. We identified a large quantity of low-quality studies, significant heterogeneity in study design and a lack of research focused on pregnancy and early infancy. In summary, despite good mechanistic evidence for the role of iron in brain development, evidence for the impact of iron deficiency or iron supplementation on early development is inconsistent. Further high-quality research is needed, particularly within pregnancy and early infancy, which has previously been neglected.},

Remarkably, \&gt;75\% extremely (\&lt;28 weeks) preterm infants who leave the NICU do not experience major neurodevelopmental disabilities, although \&gt;50\% experience more minor challenges in communication, perception, cognition, attention, regulatory, and executive function that can adversely impact educational and social function resulting in physical, behavioral, and social health issues in adulthood. Even late premature (32--36 weeks) infants have more neurodevelopmental challenges than term infants. Although early intervention and educational programs can mitigate risks of prematurity for children's developmental trajectories, restrictive eligibility requirement and limitations on frequency and intensity mean that many premature infants must ``fail first'' to trigger services. Social challenges, including lack of family resources, unsafe neighborhoods, structural racism, and parental substance use, may compound biological vulnerabilities, yet existing services are ill-equipped to respond. An intervention system for premature infants designed according to Life Course Health Development principles would instead focus on health optimization from the start; support emerging developmental capabilities such as self-regulation and formation of reciprocal secure early relationships; be tailored to each child's unique neurodevelopmental profile and social circumstances; and be vertically, horizontally, and longitudinally integrated across levels (individual, family, community), domains (health, education), and time. Recognizing the increased demands placed on parents, it would include parental mental health supports and provision of trauma-informed care. This developmental scaffolding would incorporate parenting, health, and developmental interventions, with the aim of improved health trajectories across the whole of the life course.},

Methods: SvO2 measurements using T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and susceptibility-based oximetry (SBO) were performed in 13 healthy subjects under room air, hypoxia and hypercapnia conditions. Agreement between TRUST and SBO was quantitatively evaluated. In two of the subjects, TRUST and SBO were compared against the clinical gold standard, co-oximeter measurement via internal jugular vein catheterization. Results: Absolute SvO2 measurements using TRUST and SBO were highly correlated across a range of saturations from 45 to 84\% (Pearson r = 0.91, P {$<$} 0.0001). SvO2-TRUST was significantly lower than SvO2-SBO under hypoxia and room air conditions, but the two were comparable under hypercapnia. TRUST demonstrated a larger SvO2 increase under hypercapnia than SBO. TRUST had good agreement with jugular catheterization under hypercapnia but significantly underestimated SvO2 under room air and hypoxia. The agreement between SvO2-SBO and the reference did not depend on the physiological state. Conclusion: A systematic bias was observed between T2- and susceptibility-based methods that depended on the oxygenation state. In-vivo validation with jugular catheterization indicated potential underestimation of TRUST under room air and hypoxia conditions. Our findings suggested that caution should be taken for comparison of absolute SvO2 measurements using either TRUST or SBO.},

We validated our technique in baboons by comparing the PET-measured E with E measured using an intracarotid injection of [O-15]O2. The correlation between these two techniques was excellent. Mathematical simulations were done to examine the effect of errors in CBV, CBF, and recirculating water of metabolism on the measurement of E and CMRO2.

  abstract = {In recent years, interest has grown in the potential for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of venous oxygen saturation (Yv) to improve neurological risk prediction. T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) is an MRI technique which has revealed changes in Yv in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, prior studies comparing Yv in patients with SCA relative to healthy controls have reported opposing results depending on whether the calibration model, developed to convert blood T2 to Yv, is based on healthy human hemoglobin (HbA), bovine hemoglobin (HbBV) or sickle hemoglobin (HbS). MRI Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an alternative technique that may hold promise for estimating Yv in SCA as blood magnetic susceptibility is linearly dependent upon Yv, and no significant difference has been found between the magnetic susceptibility of HbA and HbS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare estimates of Yv using QSM and TRUST with five published calibration models in healthy controls and patients with SCA. 17 patients with SCA and 13 healthy controls underwent MRI. Susceptibility maps were calculated from a multi-parametric mapping acquisition and Yv was calculated from the mean susceptibility in a region of interest in the superior sagittal sinus. TRUST estimates of T2, within a similar but much smaller region, were converted to Yv using five different calibration models. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed to compare estimates of Yv between TRUST and QSM methods. For each method, t-tests were also used to explore group-wise differences between patients with SCA and healthy controls. In healthy controls, significant correlations were observed between QSM and TRUST measures of Yv, while in SCA, there were no such correlations. The magnitude and direction of group-wise differences in Yv varied with method. The TRUST-HbBV and QSM methods suggested decreased Yv in SCA relative to healthy controls, while the TRUST-HbS (p {$<$} 0.01) and TRUST-HbA models suggested increased Yv in SCA as in previous studies. Further validation of all MRI measures of Yv, relative to ground truth measures such as O15 PET and jugular vein catheterization, is required in SCA before QSM or TRUST methods can be considered for neurological risk prediction.}

Oximetry is a technique for the assessment of blood oxygenation by measurements of light transmission through the blood, which is based on the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood provides information on the adequacy of respiration and is routinely measured in clinical settings, utilizing pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation, in venous blood (SvO2) and in the entire blood in a tissue (StO2), is related to the blood supply to the tissue, and several oximetric techniques have been developed for their assessment. SvO2 can be measured non-invasively in the fingers, making use of modified pulse oximetry, and in the retina, using the modified Beer-Lambert Law. StO2 is measured in peripheral muscle and cerebral tissue by means of various modes of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), utilizing the relative transparency of infrared light in muscle and cerebral tissue. The primary problem of oximetry is the discrimination between absorption by hemoglobin and scattering by tissue elements in the attenuation measurement, and the various techniques developed for isolating the absorption effect are presented in the current review, with their limitations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and is associated with long-term physical, neurodevelopmental, and socioeconomic effects. This study updated national preterm birth rates and trends, plus novel estimates by gestational age subgroups, to inform progress towards global health goals and targets, and aimed to update country, regional, and global estimates of preterm birth for 2020 in addition to trends between 2010 and 2020. METHODS: We systematically searched population-based, nationally representative data on preterm birth from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2020 and study data (26 March-14 April, 2021) for countries and areas with no national-level data. The analysis included 679 data points (86\% nationally representative administrative data [582 of 679 data points]) from 103 countries and areas (62\% of countries and areas having nationally representative administrative data [64 of 103 data points]). A Bayesian hierarchical regression was used for estimating country-level preterm rates, which incoporated country-specific intercepts, low birthweight as a covariate, non-linear time trends, and bias adjustments based on a data quality categorisation, and other indicators such as method of gestational age estimation. FINDINGS: An estimated 13{$\cdot$}4 million (95\% credible interval [CrI] 12{$\cdot$}3-15{$\cdot$}2 million) newborn babies were born preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) in 2020 (9{$\cdot$}9\% of all births [95\% CrI 9{$\cdot$}1-11{$\cdot$}2]) compared with 13{$\cdot$}8 million (12{$\cdot$}7-15{$\cdot$}5 million) in 2010 (9{$\cdot$}8\% of all births [9{$\cdot$}0-11{$\cdot$}0]) worldwide. The global annual rate of reduction was estimated at -0{$\cdot$}14\% from 2010 to 2020. In total, 55{$\cdot$}6\% of total livebirths are in southern Asia (26{$\cdot$}8\% [36\hphantom{,}099\hphantom{,}000 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]) and sub-Saharan Africa (28{$\cdot$}7\% [38\hphantom{,}819\hphantom{,}300 of 134\hphantom{,}767\hphantom{,}000]), yet these two regions accounted for approximately 65\% (8\hphantom{,}692\hphantom{,}000 of 13\hphantom{,}376\hphantom{,}200) of all preterm births globally in 2020. Of the 33 countries and areas in the highest data quality category, none were in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa compared with 94\% (30 of 32 countries) in high-income countries and areas. Worldwide from 2010 to 2020, approximately 15\% of all preterm births occurred at less than 32 weeks of gestation, requiring more neonatal care ({$<$}28 weeks: 4{$\cdot$}2\%, 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}1-5{$\cdot$}0, 567\hphantom{,}800 [410\hphantom{,}200-663\hphantom{,}200 newborn babies]); 28-32 weeks: 10{$\cdot$}4\% [9{$\cdot$}5-10{$\cdot$}6], 1\hphantom{,}392\hphantom{,}500 [1\hphantom{,}274\hphantom{,}800-1\hphantom{,}422\hphantom{,}600 newborn babies]). INTERPRETATION: There has been no measurable change in preterm birth rates over the last decade at global level. Despite increasing facility birth rates and substantial focus on routine health data systems, there remain many missed opportunities to improve preterm birth data. Gaps in national routine data for preterm birth are most marked in regions of southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which also have the highest estimated burden of preterm births. Countries need to prioritise programmatic investments to prevent preterm birth and to ensure evidence-based quality care when preterm birth occurs. Investments in improving data quality are crucial so that preterm birth data can be improved and used for action and accountability processes.

  abstract = {The human brain develops rapidly during 32-45 postmenstrual weeks (PMW), a critical stage characterized by dramatic increases of metabolic demand. The increasing metabolic demand can be inferred through measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), which might be coupled to regional metabolism in preterm brains. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is one of the few viable approaches for imaging regional CBF of preterm brains, but must be optimized for the extremely slow blood velocity unique in preterm brains. In this study, we explored the spatiotemporal CBF distribution in newborns scanned at the age of 32-45PMW using a pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) protocol adapted to slow blood flow in neonates. A total of 89 neonates were recruited. PCASL MRI was acquired from 34 normal newborns and phase contrast (PC) images from 19 newborns. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) were acquired from all 89 neonates for measuring cortical fractional anisotropy (FA), which characterizes cortical microstructure. Reproducible CBF measurements were obtained with the adjusted pCASL sequence. Global CBF measurement based on PC MRI was found to double its value in the 3rd trimester. Regional CBF increases were heterogeneous across the brain with a significantly higher rate of CBF increase in the frontal lobe and a lower rate of CBF increase in the occipital lobe. A significant correlation was found between frontal cortical CBF and cortical FA measurements (p{$<$}0.01). Increasing CBF values observed in the frontal lobe corresponded to lower FA values, suggesting that dendritic arborization and synaptic formation might be associated with an elevated local CBF. These results offer a preliminary account of heterogeneous regional CBF increases in a vital early developmental period and may shed the light on underlying metabolic support for cortical microstructural changes during the developmental period of 32-45PMW. Preterm effects and limitations of pCASL techniques in newborns need to be carefully considered for interpretation these results.},

  abstract = {The brain's hemodynamic and metabolism of punctate white matter lesions (PWML) is poorly understood due to a scarcity of non-invasive imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to apply new MRI techniques to quantify cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), global cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen saturation fractions in venous blood (Yv) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in neonates with PWML, for better understanding of the pathophysiology of PWML. Fifty-one newborns were recruited continuously, including 23 neonatal patients with PWML and 28 normal control neonates. Phase-contrast (PC) MRI and T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI were performed for the measurement of CBF and Yv. OEF and CMRO2 were calculated from the CBF and Yv values. The total maturation score (TMS) was assessed for each neonate on standard T1, 2-weighted images to evaluate cerebral maturation. The CMRO2, CBF, Yv, and OEF values were compared between groups, and their associations with age and TMS were evaluated. Significant differences between PWML group and control group were found in CMRO2 (P = 0.020), CBF (P = 0.027), Yv (P = 0.012), OEF (P = 0.018). After age/maturation is accounted for, Yv and OEF showed significant dependence on the groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Newborns with PWML had lower OEF and higher Yv. CMRO2, CBF and brain volume were correlated with age (P {$<$} 0.001) and TMS (P {$<$} 0.05). It is feasible to use non-invasive MRI methods to measure cerebral oxygen supply and consumption in neonates with PWML. Newborns with PWML have lower oxygen consumption. Yv and OEF may be helpful for the diagnosis of PWML. The positive correlation between CBF and TMS, and between CMRO2 and TMS suggested that as myelination progresses, the blood supply and oxygen metabolism in the brain increase to meet the escalating energy demand.},

By tilting the patient's head down 15 degrees, changes in OD may be caused by changes in cerebral blood volume. On the assumption that increases in cerebral blood volume consist of venous blood only, cerebral venous oxygen saturation can be calculated as the measured change in oxygenated Hb divided by the change in total Hb. Two groups of mechanically ventilated, newborn infants were investigated: 10 asphyxiated, term infants and another 22 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. All were monitored by near infrared spectroscopy during tilting, and cerebral blood flow was estimated by the 133Xe clearance technique immediately before tilting. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation could not be calculated in 13 preterm infants, as the blood volume remained constant during tilting. In the remaining 19, cerebral venous oxygen saturation averaged 0.67 (SD = 0.09) in asphyxiated infants and 0.53 (SD = 0.15) in preterm infants (p = 0.03). The corresponding values of cerebral blood flow were closely and inversely related to oxygen extraction calculated from cerebral venous saturation as estimated by near infrared spectroscopy.},

Methods To find such a suitable reference tissue for QSM of the brain, melanoma patients with and without brain metastases were measured. Twelve reference regions were chosen and assessed for stability of susceptibility values with respect to multiple intra-individual and inter-individual measurements, age, and stage of disease. Results Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the internal capsule and one region in the splenium of the corpus callosum are the regions with the smallest standard deviations of the mean susceptibility value. The mean susceptibility is 0.010 {\textpm} 0.014 ppm for CSF in the atrium of the lateral ventricles (csfpost), -0.060 {\textpm} 0.019 ppm for the posterior limb of the internal capsule (ci2), and -0.008 {\textpm} 0.019 ppm for the splenium of the corpus callosum. csfpost and ci2 show nearly no dependence on age or stage of disease, whereas some other regions, e.g., the red nucleus, show moderate dependence on age or disease. Conclusion The internal capsule and CSF appear to be the most suitable reference regions for QSM of the brain in the melanoma patients studied. Both showed virtually no dependence on age or disease and small variations among patients.

The goal of the present study was to examine the morphology of the corpus callosum in healthy participants of both sexes, from infancy to early adulthood. We sought to characterize normal development of the corpus callosum and possible sex differences in development. We performed a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 114 healthy individuals, aged 1 month to 25 years old, measuring the size of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum was segmented into seven subareas of the rostrum, genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium. Locally weighted regression analysis (LOESS) indicated significant non-linear age-related changes regardless of sex, particularly during the first few years of life. After this increase, curve slopes gradually became flat during adolescence and adulthood in both sexes. Age of local maximum for each subarea of the corpus callosum differed across the sexes. Ratios of total corpus callosum and genu, posterior midbody, as well as splenium to the whole brain were significantly higher in females compared with males. The present results demonstrate that the developmental trajectory of the corpus callosum during early life in healthy individuals is non-linear and dynamic. This pattern resembles that found for the cerebral cortex, further suggesting that this period plays a very important role in neural and functional development. In addition, developmental trajectories and changes in growth do show some sex differences.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but measures that track cognitive change in PD are lacking. Brain tissue iron accumulates with age and co-localises with pathological proteins linked to PD dementia such as amyloid. We used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to detect changes related to cognitive change in PD. Methods We assessed 100 patients with early-stage to mid-stage PD, and 37 age-matched controls using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a validated clinical algorithm for risk of cognitive decline in PD, measures of visuoperceptual function and the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3 (UPDRS-III). We investigated the association between these measures and QSM, an MRI technique sensitive to brain tissue iron content. Results We found QSM increases (consistent with higher brain tissue iron content) in PD compared with controls in prefrontal cortex and putamen (p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Whole brain regression analyses within the PD group identified QSM increases covarying: (1) with lower MoCA scores in the hippocampus and thalamus, (2) with poorer visual function and with higher dementia risk scores in parietal, frontal and medial occipital cortices, (3) with higher UPDRS-III scores in the putamen (all p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast, atrophy, measured using voxel-based morphometry, showed no differences between groups, or in association with clinical measures. Conclusions Brain tissue iron, measured using QSM, can track cognitive involvement in PD. This may be useful to detect signs of early cognitive change to stratify groups for clinical trials and monitor disease progression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide further quantitative studies concerning the relationship with age between regional brain iron and T2 shortening. METHODS: a) Quantitative T2 calculations of eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, temporal lobe white matter, and frontal lobe white matter) from T2-weighted spin-echo images were performed in 60 patients aged newborn to 35 years. b) Quantitative brain iron concentrations were obtained in six of the eight anatomic regions (red nucleus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, cauda, and putamen) using 13 autopsied brains (newborn to 78 years). Brain tissue from these six regions was digested with 0.6 N HCl-2.5\% wt/vol KMnO4 for 2 hours at 60 degrees C. After centrifugation, 0.1 mL of an iron-chelating reagent (2 mol/L ascorbic acid, 5 mol/L ammonium acetate, 6.5 nmol/L ferrozine, 13.1 mmol/L neocuprine) was added and the absorbance was measured at 562 nm/L and compared with a standard curve with ferric chloride. c) The in vivo iron concentrations in tissue that were obtained were reproduced in four test tube phantom studies with ferric ammonium sulfate or ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolved in either deionized water or 5\% agarose. T2 calculations of the phantoms were made with a single-section multiple repetition time, multiple echo time acquisition. RESULTS: a) Clinical T2 calculations--all eight anatomic regions showed a decrease with age in T2 value, beginning shortly after birth. During the first three decades, the T2 shortening was most significant in the region of substantia nigra. b) Quantitative brain iron--five anatomic regions but not the corpus callosum demonstrated an age-related increase in brain iron (1449.6 nmol/g for the red nucleus versus 261.8 nmol/g for the corpus callosum). c) T2 effect of iron in vitro--both the ferric and ferrous iron phantoms showed a decreased T2 value in the in vivo concentration range of iron obtained from the postmortem studies. The T2 shortening was most marked for the ferric phantoms. CONCLUSION: There is an age-related accumulation of iron in five regions of the brain, correlating with an associated decrease in T2 value that can be demonstrated in iron phantoms. Brain iron appears to contribute to the progressive decrease of T2 signal that occurs with aging.},

Thus, the clinical applications of QSM are wide-reaching and hold great promise as imaging biomarkers for studying several neurological diseases.

  abstract = {Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has enabled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tissue magnetic susceptibility to advance from simple qualitative detection of hypointense blooming artifacts to precise quantitative measurement of spatial biodistributions. QSM technology may be regarded to be sufficiently developed and validated to warrant wide dissemination for clinical applications of imaging isotropic susceptibility, which is dominated by metals in tissue, including iron and calcium. These biometals are highly regulated as vital participants in normal cellular biochemistry, and their dysregulations are manifested in a variety of pathologic processes. Therefore, QSM can be used to assess important tissue functions and disease. To facilitate QSM clinical translation, this review aims to organize pertinent information for implementing a robust automated QSM technique in routine MRI practice and to summarize available knowledge on diseases for which QSM can be used to improve patient care. In brief, QSM can be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification; and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance requires contrast agent injection. Clinicians may consider integrating QSM into their routine imaging practices by including gradient echo sequences in all relevant MRI protocols. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J.

  abstract = {In MRI, the main magnetic field polarizes the electron cloud of a molecule, generating a chemical shift for observer protons within the molecule and a magnetic susceptibility inhomogeneity field for observer protons outside the molecule. The number of water protons surrounding a molecule for detecting its magnetic susceptibility is vastly greater than the number of protons within the molecule for detecting its chemical shift. However, the study of tissue magnetic susceptibility has been hindered by poor molecular specificities of hitherto used methods based on MRI signal phase and T2* contrast, which depend convolutedly on surrounding susceptibility sources. Deconvolution of the MRI signal phase can determine tissue susceptibility but is challenged by the lack of MRI signal in the background and by the zeroes in the dipole kernel. Recently, physically meaningful regularizations, including the Bayesian approach, have been developed to enable accurate quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for studying iron distribution, metabolic oxygen consumption, blood degradation, calcification, demyelination, and other pathophysiological susceptibility changes, as well as contrast agent biodistribution in MRI. This paper attempts to summarize the basic physical concepts and essential algorithmic steps in QSM, to describe clinical and technical issues under active development, and to provide references, codes, and testing data for readers interested in QSM.

While there are numerous algorithms developed to solve this ill-posed inverse problem, estimating susceptibility maps with a wide range of values is still problematic. In cases such as large veins, contrast agent uptake, and intracranial hemorrhages, extreme susceptibility values in focal areas cause severe streaking artifacts. To enable the reduction of these artifacts while preserving subtle susceptibility contrast, a two-level QSM reconstruction algorithm (STAR-QSM) was developed in this study by tuning a regularization parameter to automatically reconstruct both large and small susceptibility values. Compared to current state-of-the-art QSM methods such as iLSQR, STAR-QSM significantly reduced streaking artifacts while preserving sharp boundaries for blood vessels of mouse brains in vivo and fine anatomical details of high resolution mouse brains ex vivo. Brain image data from patients with cerebral hematoma and multiple sclerosis further illustrated the superiority of this method in reducing streaking artifacts caused by large susceptibility sources while maintaining sharp anatomical details. STAR-QSM is implemented in STI Suite, a comprehensive shareware for susceptibility imaging and quantification.},

Existing techniques for quantification of CMRO2 with positron emission tomography (PET) or MRI involve special equipment and/or exogenous agents, and may not be suitable for routine clinical studies. In the present study, a noninvasive method is developed to estimate whole-brain CMRO2 in humans. This method applies phase-contrast MRI for quantitative blood flow measurement and T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI for venous oxygenation estimation, and uses the Fick principle of arteriovenous difference for the calculation of CMRO2. Whole-brain averaged CMRO2 values in young, healthy subjects were 132.1 {\textpm} 20.0 {$\mu$}mol/100 g/min, in good agreement with literature reports using PET. Various acquisition strategies for phase-contrast and TRUST MRI were compared, and it was found that nongated phase-contrast and sagittal sinus (SS) TRUST MRI were able to provide the most efficient and accurate estimation of CMRO2. In addition, blood flow and venous oxygenation were found to be positively correlated across subjects. Owing to the noninvasive nature of this method, it may be a convenient and useful approach for assessment of brain metabolism in brain disorders as well as under various physiologic conditions.

MRI was performed and S\emph{{$\nu$}O}\textsubscript{2} was calculated using SWI-MRI data obtained in the straight section of the superior sagittal sinus.

METHODS: Thirty-six pregnant women, having a mean gestational age (GA) of 31 2/7 weeks, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) data from the foetal brain were acquired. ∆{$\chi$} v of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) was quantified using MR susceptometry from the intra-vascular phase measurements. Assuming the magnetic property of foetal blood, ∆{$\chi$} do , is the same as that of adult blood, S v O 2 was derived from the measured {$\Delta\chi$} v . The variation of ∆{$\chi$} v and S v O 2, as a function of GA, was statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The mean ∆{$\chi$} v in the SSS in the second-trimester (n = 8) and third-trimester foetuses (n = 28) was found to be 0.34{\textpm} 0.06 ppm and 0.49 {\textpm}0.05 ppm, respectively. Correspondingly, the derived S v O 2 values were 69.4\% {\textpm}3.27\% and 62.6\% {\textpm}3.25\%. Although not statistically significant, an increasing trend (p = 0.08) in {$\Delta\chi$} v and a decreasing trend (p = 0.22) in S v O 2 with respect to advancing gestation was observed. CONCLUSION: We report cerebral venous blood magnetic susceptibility and putative oxygen saturation in healthy human foetuses. Cerebral oxygen saturation in healthy human foetuses, despite a slight decreasing trend, does not change significantly with advancing gestation. KEY POINTS: {$\bullet$} Cerebral venous magnetic susceptibility and oxygenation in human foetuses can be quantified. {$\bullet$} Cerebral venous oxygenation was not different between second- and third-trimester foetuses. {$\bullet$} Foetal cerebral venous oxygenation does not change significantly with advancing gestation.},

METHODS: Twenty-six AD patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were prospectively recruited in this study. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate cognitive status. We applied the QQ-CCTV algorithm which combines quantitative susceptibility mapping and quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent models (QQ) for OEF calculation. CBF map was computed from arterial spin labeling and CMRO2 was generated based on Fick's principle. Whole-brain and regional OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 analyses were performed. The associations between these measures in substructures of deep brain gray matter and MMSE scores were assessed. RESULTS: Whole brain voxel-wise analysis showed that CBF and CMRO2 values significantly decreased in AD predominantly in the bilateral angular gyrus, precuneus gyrus and parieto-temporal regions. Regional analysis showed that CBF value decreased in the bilateral caudal hippocampus and left rostral hippocampus and CMRO2 value decreased in left caudal and rostral hippocampus in AD patients. Considering all subjects in the AD and HC groups combined, the mean CBF and CMRO2 values in the bilateral hippocampus positively correlated with the MMSE score. CONCLUSION: CMRO2 mapping with the QQ-CCTV method - which is readily available in MR systems for clinical practice - can be a potential biomarker for AD. In addition, CMRO2 in the hippocampus may be a useful tool for monitoring cognitive impairment.},

Although cerebral maturation is associated with an increase in cerebral glucose consumption, the relationship between CVO2 and increasing gestational age has not previously been assessed in humans. The aims of this study were to evaluate a noninvasive method for the estimation of CVO2 in the neonate using near infrared spectroscopy, and to investigate the relationship between gestational age and CVO2. Twenty babies who were undergoing intensive care in the neonatal period were studied. Cerebral hemoglobin flow (CHbF) and cerebral venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (CSVO2) were measured using near infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was measure by pulse oximetry (SpO2). CVO2 was calculated from the equation: CVO2=CHbF x (SpO2 - SvO2 x 4. The median (range) CVO2 was 0.9 (0.52-1.76) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1). There was an increase in CVO2 with advancing gestational age (n=20, p=0.55, p=0.014). We conclude that CVO2 can be estimated in sick neonates using noninvasive optical methods. The values obtained are similar to those obtained in other studies by more invasive methods, and are in agreement with values which would be expected from the known rate of cerebral glucose consumption in neonates. Mean (SD) CVO2 at 24-26 wk was 0.5 (0.18) mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) and rose with increasing gestation to term by 0.03 mL x 100 g(-1) min(-1) per wk.},

  abstract = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential cofactor for many proteins that are involved in normal neuronal tissue function, but there is increasing evidence that iron accumulation in the brain can cause a vast array of CNS disorders.Global iron homeostasis is regulated at the level of iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. This involves a series of molecular interactions between proteins that include the haemochromatosis gene product HFE, transferrin, the transferrin receptor and iron regulatory proteins in the crypts of Lieberk{\"u}hn.The brain has several characteristics that make it unique with regard to iron metabolism. It resides behind a vascular barrier --- the blood--brain barrier --- which limits its access to plasma iron. Also, the concentration of iron varies considerably between different brain regions: regions that are associated with motor functions tend to have more iron than non-motor-related regions.Iron seems to accumulate in the brain as a function of age. This process is quite specific, and it involves the accumulation of iron-containing molecules in certain cell types, particularly in brain regions that are preferentially targeted in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).PD is associated with increased iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. Proposed mechanisms for iron-induced cell damage in PD include enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and an increase in oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This includes the aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, which is one of the main components of Lewy bodies --- one of the pathological hallmarks of PD.In AD, iron accumulation in the brain occurs without the normal age-related increase in ferritin, and this increases the risk of oxidative stress. Iron might also have a direct impact on plaque formation through its effects on amyloid precursor protein processing.Iron accumulation has also been implicated in several other neurological diseases, including congenital aceruloplasminaemia, Friedreich's ataxia, neuroferritinopathy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and restless legs syndrome.Metal chelators are being developed as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD, AD and other neurodegenerative disorders that involve iron misregulation.If we can understand the timing of iron mismanagement in relation to the progression of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases and during ageing, this might raise the possibility of monitoring iron changes as a marker of disease progression, and perhaps even pre-clinical diagnosis in conditions where iron mismanagement is an early event.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal brain atlases play an important role in the study of human brain development and cognition. Existing atlases are mainly based on anatomical features derived from T1-and T2-weighted MRI. A 4D developmental quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) atlas may facilitate the estimation of age-related iron changes in deep gray matter nuclei and myelin changes in white matter. To this end, group-wise co-registered QSM templates were generated over various age intervals from age 1--83 years old. Registration was achieved by combining both T1-weighted and QSM images. Based on the proposed template, we created an accurate deep gray matter nuclei parcellation map (DGM map). Notably, we segmented thalamus into 5 sub-regions, i.e. the anterior nuclei, the median nuclei, the lateral nuclei, the pulvinar and the internal medullary lamina. Furthermore, we built a ``whole brain QSM parcellation map'' by combining existing cortical parcellation and white-matter atlases with the proposed DGM map. Based on the proposed QSM atlas, the segmentation accuracy of iron-rich nuclei using QSM is significantly improved, especially for children and adolescent subjects. The age-related progression of magnetic susceptibility in each of the deep gray matter nuclei, the hippocampus, and the amygdala was estimated. Our automated atlas-based analysis provided a systematic confirmation of previous findings on susceptibility progression with age resulting from manual ROI drawings in deep gray matter nuclei. The susceptibility development in the hippocampus and the amygdala follow an iron accumulation model; while in the thalamus sub-regions, the susceptibility development exhibits a variety of trends. It is envisioned that the newly developed 4D QSM atlas will serve as a template for studying brain iron deposition and myelination/demyelination in both normal aging and various brain diseases.},

  abstract = {The human brain rapidly develops during the first two years following birth. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides information of iron and myelin variations. It is considered to be a valuable tool for studying brain development in early life. In the present work, QSM is performed on neonates, 1-year and 2-year old infants, as well as a group of adults for the purpose of reference. Age-specific templates representing common brain structures are built for each age group. The neonate and infant QSM templates have shown some unique findings compared to conventional T1w and T2w imaging techniques. The contrast between the gray and white matters on the QSM images did not change through brain development from neonate to adult. A linear correlation was found between brain myelination determined in this study and the microscopic myelin degree determined by a previous autopsy study. Also, the magnetic susceptibility values of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) exhibit a gradually decreasing trend from birth to 2 years old and to adulthood. The findings suggest that the macromolecular content, myelin, and iron may play the most important contributing factors for the magnetic susceptibility of neonate and infant brain. QSM can be a powerful means to study early brain development and related pathologies that involve alterations in macromolecular content, iron, or brain myelination.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth (PTB) is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Globally, 15 million infants are born prematurely, putting these children at an increased risk of mortality and lifelong health challenges. Currently in the U.S., there is only one FDA approved therapy for the prevention of preterm birth. Makena is an intramuscular progestin injection given to women who have experienced a premature delivery in the past. Recently, however, Makena failed a confirmatory trial, resulting the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER) recommendation for the FDA to withdrawal Makena's approval. This recommendation would leave clinicians with no therapeutic options for preventing PTB. Here, we outline recent interdisciplinary efforts involving physicians, pharmacologists, biologists, chemists, and engineers to understand risk factors associated with PTB, mechanisms that contribute to PTB, and to develop next generation therapies for preventing PTB. These advances have the potential to better identify women at risk for PTB, prevent the onset of premature labor, and, ultimately, save infant lives.,},
